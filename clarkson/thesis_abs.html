<h3>Abstract:</h3>
This dissertation reports a variety of new algorithms for solving
closest-point problems.&nbsp; The input to these algorithms is a set or
sets of points in <span style="font-style: italic;">d</span>-dimensional
space, with an associated&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">L<small>p<big>
</big></small></span><small><big>metric.&nbsp; The problems considered
are:<br>
</big></small>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The all nearest neighbors
problem.&nbsp; </span>For point set <span style="font-style: italic;">A,
    </span>find the nearest neighbors in&nbsp; <span
 style="font-style: italic;">A </span>of each point in <span
 style="font-style: italic;">A</span>.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The nearest foreign neighbor
problem.&nbsp; </span>For point sets <span style="font-style: italic;">A</span>
and <span style="font-style: italic;">B</span>, find the closest point
in <span style="font-style: italic;">B</span> to each point in <span
 style="font-style: italic;">A</span>.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">The geometric minimum spanning
tree problem.&nbsp; </span>For point set <span
 style="font-style: italic;">A</span>, find the minimum spanning tree
for the complete weighted undirected graph associated with <span
 style="font-style: italic;">A</span>, where the vertices of the graph
correspond to the points of <span style="font-style: italic;">A</span>,
and the weight of an edge is the distance between the points defining
the edge.</li>
</ul>
These problems arise in routing, statistical classification, data
compression, and other areas.&nbsp; Obvious algorithms for them require
a running time quadratic in <span style="font-style: italic;">n</span>,
the number of points in the input.&nbsp; In many cases they can be
solved with algorithms requiring <span style="font-style: italic;">O(n
</span>log<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span><sup
 style="font-style: italic;">O(1)</sup><span style="font-style: italic;">
n) </span>time.<br>
<br>
In this work, approximation algorithms for some cases of these problems
have been found.&nbsp; For example, for the minimum spanning tree
problem with the <span style="font-style: italic;">L<sub>1</sub></span>
metric, an algorithm has been devised that requires <span
 style="font-style: italic;">O(n </span>log<span
 style="font-style: italic;"> d(1/rho) </span>time to find a spanning
tree with weight within <span style="font-style: italic;">1+rho</span>
of the minimum.&nbsp; Several other algorithms have been found with
time bounds dependent on log<span style="font-style: italic;">(1/rho)</span>
for attaining error <span style="font-style: italic;">rho</span>.<br>
<br>
Algorithms have also been found that require linear expected time, for
independent identically distributed random input points with a
probability density function satisfying weak conditions.&nbsp; One such
algorithm depends on the fact that under certain conditions, values
that are identically distributed, but dependent, can be bucket sorted
in linear expected time.<br>
<br>
An algorithm has been found for the all nearest neighbors problem that
requires <span style="font-style: italic;">O(n </span>log <span
 style="font-style: italic;">n)</span> expected time for any input set
of points, where the expectation is on the random sampling performed by
the algorithm.&nbsp; This algorithm involves the construction of a new
data structure, a compressed form of digital trie.<br>
