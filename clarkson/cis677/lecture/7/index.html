<h3>Outline</h3>
<li>	Caratheodory's theorem

<li>	convex hulls and intersections of halfspaces
<li>	faces and the face lattice
<li>	faces and polarity
</ul>

We'll be using the following terms:

<table>
<tr><th>polytope<td>	the convex hull conv(S) of a finite set S.
<tr><th><i>H</i>-polyhedron<td>	the intersection P(H) of a set of halfspaces.
<tr><th><i>V</i>-polyhedron<td>	a Minkowski sum conv(S)+cone(S'), where S and S' are finite.
</table>

We'll prove the <i>Representation Theorem</i>, that
a set is an <i>H</i>-polyhedron iff it is a <i>V</i>-polyhedron.

<p>
We'll show that a polyhedron is bounded iff it is a polytope.


<h3>Cones and Convex Sets, Homogeneous coordinates</h3>

Statements about convex sets can be translated into statements about
cones in one higher dimension.

That is, define

<table>
<tr><th>lift(P) <td>to be {[x 1] | x is in P}, and
<tr> <th>slice(P') <td> to be {x | [x 1] is in P'}.
</table>


<blockquote>
<b>Fact:</b> conv(S)=slice(cone(lift(S))).
</blockquote>

<p>
Proof: 
Let Y=lift(S).

<p>
A point x is in slice(cone(Y))
<blockquote>
	iff [x 1] is in cone(Y),<br>
	iff  [x 1] = sum<sub>p in Y</sub> c<sub>p</sub> p, where p=[p' 1].<br>
	iff x = sum<sub>p in Y</sub> c<sub>p</sub> p' and sum<sub>p in Y</sub> c<sub>p</sub> = 1<br>
	iff x is in conv(S).  <b>QED</b><br>
</blockquote>
 

<p>
This can be viewed as using <i>homogeneous coordinates</i>:
regard any point [y y<sub>d+1</sub>] as representing point x if
[y y<sub>d+1</sub>] = t[x 1] for some t>0.  That is, cone(Y) is the set of
all [y y<sub>d+1</sub>] that represent conv(S) in homogeneous coordinates.

<p>
Statements about flats can be translated into statements about linear subspaces
in one higher dimension, because:
<blockquote>
aff(P)=slice(span(lift(P))).
</blockquote>

<p>
A set P is affinely dependent iff lift(P) is linearly dependent.

<p>
A similar relation holds between cones and <i>H</i>-polyhedra: suppose P(H) is such
a polyhedron.<br>
For a halfspace
<blockquote>
	h={x | a&#183;x <=b},
</blockquote>
let h' be the
halfspace in one dimension up with
<blockquote>
	h':={ [x x<sub>d+1</sub>]  | a&#183;x - bx<sub>d+1</sub> <= 0},
</blockquote>
and H' the set of h', together with the halfspace {x | x<sub>d+1</sub> >= 0}.

Then P(H) = slice(P(H')), and P(H') is a cone.


<h3>Caratheodory's theorem</h3>

Every linear subspace L has a basis : a small set B in L with L=span(B).

<table><tr><td>
<p>
As will be shown,
the vertices of a bounded polyhedral set P are like a basis
for convex combinations: P=conv(vert(P)).

<p>
However, there's no bound on the number of vertices, as a function of
dim(P), as there is for a linear subspace.

But:

<blockquote>
<b>Theorem.</b>
<ol type=i>
<li>Given a set S, for any point p in conv(S) there is a subset T with
p in conv(T), with |T| = dim(S)+1, and the points of S' are affinely
independent.
<li> Given a set S, for any point p in cone(S), there is a subset T of S
with p in cone(T), with |T|=dim(S), and the points of T are linearly
independent.
</ol>
</blockquote>

Proof.
Part (ii):
Suppose T' is a subset of S
such that:
<blockquote>
 	p is in cone(T'),<br>
 	the size |T'| is as small as possible,<br>
	but |T'| > dim(S).
</blockquote>
Suppose p=sum<sub>s in T'</sub> c<sub>s</sub> s.
Then T' is linearly dependent, so for some
coefficients d<sub>s</sub>,
<blockquote>
	sum<sub>s in T'</sub> d<sub>s</sub> c<sub>s</sub> s = 0.
</blockquote>
Pick the element s<sub>max</sub> of T' with the largest d<sub>s</sub>,
and write
<blockquote>
	c<sub>s</sub>s <sub>max</sub> = sum<sub>s in T'\{s<sub>max</sub>}</sub> -d<sub>s</sub>/d<sub>max</sub> c<sub>s</sub> s.
</blockquote>
Note that that each coefficient on the right is greater than -c<sub>s</sub>.
<p>
Now substitute this expression for s<sub>max</sub> into the sum
for p.  This eliminates the appearence of s<sub>max</sub> in the sum,
and keeps all other coefficients nonnegative.  This contradicts
the choice of T'.

<p>
Part (i) follows from conv(S)=slice(cone(lift(S))) and using 
 <b>QED</b>

<h3>A Farkas Lemma</h3>

The Farkas Lemma is fundamental to the theory of polytopes; it
is a form of linear programming duality, and takes many forms.<br>
One form says:

<table><tr><td>
Given a set S and a point p, either
<ol type=i>
<li> p is in conv(S), or
<li> there is a hyperplane h
such that p is on one side of h, and S is on the other,
</ol>
but not both (i) and (ii).
<td><img src="f1.gif"></tr></table>

<p>
It will be useful to have a version of this lemma for cones; it's
possible to say more about the separating hyperplane, also:
it can be the affine hull (in the convex case) or the linear span
(in the cone case) of a subset of S.

<blockquote>
<b>Farkas Lemma.</b> Given a set S and a point p, either
<ol type=i>
<li> p is in cone(S), or
<li> there is a linear subspace span(T), such that p is on one side of span(T),
and S is on the other, where
<blockquote>
	T is a subset of S,<br>
	|T| is no more than dim(S)-1, and<br>
	T is linearly independent,<br>
</blockquote>
</ol>
but not both (i) and (ii).
</blockquote>

<p>
This can be viewed as a "theorem of the alternative": either one system
of inequalities holds, expressing that (i) holds, or another
system does, expressing that (ii) holds.

<p>
The Lemma can be viewed as showing that there is a "witness", span(T),
to p not being in cone(S): an easy-to-check proof that p is not in cone(S).

<p>
Here we use it to show the relation between <i>V</i>-polyhedral sets, given as
convex hulls, and <i>H</i>-polyhedral sets, given as halfspace intersections.

<h3>Proof sketch of the Farkas Lemma</h3>

If p is in cone(S), then there can be no a with
<blockquote>
	a&#183;p > 0 and a&#183;s <= 0 for all s in S,
</blockquote>
because p in cone(S) means p = sum<sub>s in S</sub> c<sub>s</sub> s, with c<sub>s</sub> >= 0 for all s.
But then a&#183;s <= 0 for all s implies
<blockquote>
	0 > a&#183;p = a&#183;sum<sub>s in S</sub> c<sub>s</sub> s = sum<sub>s in S</sub> c<sub>s</sub> a&#183;s >= 0,
</blockquote>
contradiction.

<table><tr><td>
<p>
Suppose p is not in cone(S).  Then by Caratheodory's theorem, p is not
in any <i>simplicial cone</i> cone(S'), having |S'| = dim(S),
and with S' a subset of S.

<p>
Pick a point q inside one such simplicial cone,
and consider the intersections
of the line qp with all such simplicial cones arising from S.
Let q' be the intersection
point closest to p.  Then q' is in some cone(T),
where |T|=dim(S)-1, and span(T) separates S and p: suppose there is
some point s on the same side of span(T) as p;
Then, <i>as can be shown,</i> the intersection of L and
cone(T union s) has an endpoint closer to p than q'.
<td><img src="f2.gif"></table>
<p>
Put another way: pick a cone(T) with |T|=dim(S)-1, with q a point in cone(T),
and suppose a point s of S is on the same side of span(T) as p.  Then for 
some s' in T, cone(T union s \ s') has intersection with qp
closer the p than the intersection of qp with cone(T).  Reset
T to be T union s \ s', and repeat until either a separating plane
is found, or p is in some cone.  <b>QED</b>

<p>
This proof is really a disguised form of the simplex algorithm
for linear programming, of which more later. 

<p>
It is not hard to prove the <i> "as can be shown"</i> condition, using the linear
independence of the sets T yielding the cones.


<h3> Polarity </h3>

Polarity, and more generally <i>duality</i>, are key concepts of convexity.

<p>
Suppose P(H) is a cone, with all bounding hyperplanes passing through
the origin.

<table><tr><td>
<p>
From the definition of P(H), we have
<blockquote>
h<sup>*</sup>&#183;x <= 0 for every h in H and every x in P(H), 
</blockquote>
where h<sup>*</sup> is any vector perpendicular to h and not in it.
That is, every x in P(H) lies in every halfspace associated with each 
h<sup>*</sup>.  However, the above also says that
each h<sup>*</sup> lies in the intersection of a set of halfspaces,
namely, those bounded by planes perpendicular to x.
<td><img src="f3.gif"></table>

<p>
We'll define the <i>polar</i> P(H)<sup>*</sup> of P(H) as the
intersection of all those halfspaces, so that, parallel to the above,
<blockquote>
y&#183;x <= 0 for every y in P(H)<sup>*</sup> and every x in P(H), 
</blockquote>

This may motivate the following definitions:
<table>
<tr><th valign=top align=right>h<sup>*</sup> </th><td>:= for a halfspace h, the ray of all vectors a with
	so that h = {x | a&#183;x <= 0}.
<tr><th valign=top align=right>r<sup>*</sup> </th><td>:= for a ray r, the halfspace of all vectors x with
	b&#183;x <= 0 for b in r.
<tr><th valign=top align=right>H<sup>*</sup> </th><td>:= {h<sup>*</sup> | h in H}.</td></tr>
<tr><th valign=top align=right>P(H)<sup>*</sup> </th><td>:= {y | y&#183;x <= 0 for all x in P(H)}, the <i>polar</i> of P(H).</td></tr>
</table>

<table><tr><td>
It will be convenient to confuse a ray h<sup>*</sup> and a member of it,
so we will write h<sup>*</sup>&#183;x to mean that b&#183;x for
b in h<sup>*</sup> of unit length.

<p>
Note that if H is a single halfspace h, then P(H)<sup>*</sup>=h<sup>*</sup>,
so this notation is consistent.  Also h<sup>**</sup>=h.

<p>
The Farkas lemma for cones says that if p is not in cone(S),
then there is some w with w&#183;s <= 0 for s in S, but w&#183;y > 0.
That is, w is a member of cone(S)<sup>*</sup>, and w&#183;y > 0.

<p>
Polarity can be used to show that halfspace intersection is algorithmically
equivalent to convex hull.  Dual transforms like
polarity can be used to illuminate the relationship
between Delaunay triangulations and Voronoi diagrams.
<td><img src="f4.gif"></table>

<blockquote>
<b>Theorem.</b>  P(H)<sup>*</sup> = cone(H<sup>*</sup>).
</blockquote>

Proof.
Suppose y is in cone(H<sup>*</sup>).  Then for any x in P(H),
<blockquote>
	y&#183;x = sum<sub>h in H</sub> c<sub>h</sub> h<sup>*</sup>&#183;x,
</blockquote>
for some nonnegative values c<sub>h</sub>.
But this is no more than 0, since x is in P(H),
and so y is in P(H)<sup>*</sup>.

<p>
Suppose y is not in cone(H<sup>*</sup>).  Then by the Farkas lemma,
there is a vector w with y&#183;w > 0, and with w&#183;x <= 0 for all
x in cone(H<sup>*</sup>).  But the latter implies w is in P(H), and so y&#183;w > 0
implies y is not in P(H)<sup>*</sup>.
 <b>QED</b>

<blockquote>
<b>Theorem.</b>  P(H)<sup>**</sup> = P(H).
</blockquote>

Proof.  That is, the polar of the polar is the original set.
We have
<blockquote>
	P(H)<sup>**</sup> = { x | y&#183;x <= 0 for all y in P(H)<sup>*</sup>}.
</blockquote>
Suppose x is in P(H)<sup>**</sup>.  Then
since P(H)<sup>*</sup>=cone(H<sup>*</sup>), which contains H<sup>*</sup>, x&#183;y <=0 for y in H<sup>*</sup>,
but that implies x is in P(H).

Now suppose x is in P(H).  This implies y&#183;x <= 0 for any y in P(H)<sup>*</sup>.
Hence x is in P(H)<sup>**</sup>.
 <b>QED</b>


<h3><i>H</i>-cones and <i>V</i>-cones</h3>

<blockquote>
<b>Theorem. (Representation Theorem for Cones.)</b>
A cone C has the form cone(S) for some finite set S iff C has the
form P(H) for a finite set H of halfspaces.
</blockquote>

<b>Proof.</b>
Given cone(S),
suppose p is not in cone(S).  Then by the Farkas lemma,
there is some span(T), with T a subset of S of size dim(S)-1, that separates
p and S.  So if H<sub>S</sub> is the set of halfspaces
<blockquote>
	H<sub>S</sub> := {h | h is bounded by span(T), T subset S, |T| = dim(S)-1, h contains S},
</blockquote>
then p not in cone(S) implies that p is not in P(H<sub>S</sub>).
That is, P(H<sub>S</sub>) is a subset of cone(S).
But P(H<sub>S</sub>) contains S, and so contains cone(S), and so
cone(S)=P(H<sub>S</sub>).


<p>
Given P(H),
consider P(H)<sup>*</sup>=cone(H<sup>*</sup>).  As just seen,
there is a finite set of halfspaces
H<sub>c</sub> such that
<blockquote>
	P(H)<sup>*</sup> = cone(H<sup>*</sup>) = P(H<sub>c</sub>).
</blockquote>
But then
<blockquote>
	P(H)=P(H)<sup>**</sup> = P(H<sub>c</sub>)<sup>*</sup> = cone(H<sub>c</sub>),
</blockquote>
using the previous two theorems,
and so P(H) can be written as cone generated by H<sub>c</sub>.
 <b>QED</b>



<blockquote>
<b>Theorem.</b>
A convex set C has the form P(H) for a finite set H of halfspaces
if and only if it has the form conv(S<sub>1</sub>)+cone(S<sub>0</sub>) for some finite sets S<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>0</sub>.
</blockquote>

<b>Proof.</b>
Pass from P(H) to the corresponding cone P(H') in one dimension higher,
as discussed above.  By the Representation Theorem for cones,
the cone P(H') is equal to cone(T), for some finite set T.  A point x' in T
has the form [x x<sub>d+1</sub>], and since we're only interested in cone(T), we
can change T to T', where T'= T<sub>1</sub> union T<sub>0</sub>, with
<blockquote>
	T<sub>1</sub> := {[x/x<sub>d+1</sub> 1] | [x x<sub>d+1</sub>] in T, x<sub>d+1</sub>!=0},
</blockquote>
and T<sub>0</sub> := T \ T<sub>1</sub>, that is, all the members of T with x<sub>d+1</sub>=0.
Then cone(T)=cone(T<sub>1</sub>) + cone(T<sub>0</sub>);
if we let
<blockquote>
	S<sub>1</sub> := {x | [x 1] is in T<sub>1</sub>}, and<br>
	S<sub>0</sub> := {x | [x 0] is in T<sub>0</sub>},
</blockquote>
then
<blockquote>
	conv(S<sub>1</sub>)= {x | [x 1] in cone(T<sub>1</sub>)}, and <br>
	cone(S<sub>0</sub>) = {x | [x 0] in cone(T<sub>0</sub>)},
</blockquote>
and
<blockquote>
	conv(S<sub>1</sub>) + cone(S<sub>0</sub>) = slice(cone(T)) = P(H).
</blockquote>

Showing that cone(S<sub>1</sub>) + cone(S<sub>0</sub>) is
an <i>H</i>-polyhedron will probably be an exercise.
 <b>QED</b>

<p>
From this, it follows that a polyhedron is a polytope iff it is bounded:
that is, a polyhedron conv(S<sub>1</sub>)+cone(S<sub>0</sub>) is bounded iff cone(S<sub>0</sub>) is empty.


<h3>Corollaries</h3>

Here are some facts that follow easily from these results.
Notice that the first two are easy for <i>H</i>-polyhedra, and the rest
are easier for <i>V</i>-polyhedra.

<blockquote>
	The intersection of two polyhedra is a polyhedron.

<p>
	Since a flat is a polyhedron, the intersection of a polyhedron
	with a flat is a polyhedron.

<p>
	The projection of a polyhedron is a polyhedron.

<p>
	The Minkowski sum of two polyhedra is a polyhedron.
</blockquote>

<h3>Polarity for Polyhedra</h3>

So far, the definition of polarity has only been for the case of cones.
To extend this concept to a polyhedron P, we define
<blockquote>
	P<sup>*</sup> := {y | y&#183;x <= 1 for all x in P}.
</blockquote>
This defintion is the same for cones as the previous one:
if y&#183;x <= 1 for all x in a cone, then y&#183;x <= 0 for all x.
<p>
Any supporting halfspace h = {x | a&#183;x <= b} can also be decribed
with b=1, as long as b!=0.  If P contains 0 in its interior,
then all its supporting halfspaces can be put in a form that
has b=1.  Also, P<sup>*</sup> always contains 0.  So, for
theorems like P<sup>**</sup>=P, the additional condition that 0 is
in the interior of P is needed.

<p>
If h={x | y&#183;x <= 1}, define h<sup>*</sup> as y and y<sup>*</sup> as h.

<p>
We have:
<blockquote>
<b> Facts</b>
When P, P(H), and conv(S) are polytopes containing the origin, then
their polars are also, and:
<blockquote>
	P<sup>**</sup>=P;<br>
	P(H)<sup>*</sup> = conv(H<sup>*</sup>).<br>
	conv(S)<sup>*</sup> = P(S<sup>*</sup>).<br>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>


<b>Proof.</b> The last two can be proven using the mapping to cones and back.


<h3>Faces</h3>

<table>
<tr><th valign=top>Supporting<br>halfspace:
<td>A closed halfspace h is a <i>supporting halfspace</i> of a polyhedron P if
h contains P.

<tr><th valign=top>Face:
<td>A <i>face</i> f of a polyhedron P is the intersection of
P with the plane bounding a supporting halfspace h.
We will say that h is a <i>witness</i> for f.

</table>

<p>
Note that if h is a supporting halfspace of a cone C,
then h<sup>*</sup> is in C<sup>*</sup>.

<p>
For completeness, we include the polyhedron itself as a face.  Notice
that the empty set is a face.  The remaining faces are called 
<i>proper</i>.
<p>
Let

<table><tr><td>
<table>
<tr><th>faces(P)</th><td>
denote the set of faces of a polyhedron P.

<tr valign=top><th>vertices:</th><td>
faces of P of dimension 0 (single points);
the set of vertices is denoted vert(P).

<tr valign=top><th>edges:</th><td>
faces of P of dimension 1 (line segments).

<tr valign=top><th>facets:</th><td>
faces of P of dimension dim(P)-1.

<tr valign=top><th>ridges:</th><td>
faces of P of dimension dim(P)-2.
</table>
<td><img src="f5.gif"></table>

<p>
In Lecture 1, vertices were defined as points in the convex hull
that could not be written as convex combinations of other points in
the hull.  The two definitions are equivalent:

<blockquote>
<b>Lemma</b>.
If v is in conv(S), then:
<blockquote>
	v is in vert(conv(S)) iff v is not in conv(S\{v}).
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<b>Proof</b>.
Suppose v is a vertex, so there is some halfspace h={x | a&#183;x <=b} with
S a subset of h, a&#183;v = b, and a&#183;x < b for all x in conv(S)\{v}.
Then any convex combination
<blockquote>
	sum<sub>p in S\{v}</sub> c<sub>p</sub> p
</blockquote>
will have
<blockquote>
	a&#183;sum<sub>p in S\{v}</sub> c<sub>p</sub> p = sum<sub>p in S\{v}</sub> c<sub>p</sub> a&#183;p < b,
</blockquote>
and so v is not in conv(S\{v}).

On the other hand, suppose v is in conv(S) but not conv(S\{v}).
Then by the Farkas lemma, there a halfspace
<blockquote>
	h' := {x | a'&#183;x <= b'}
</blockquote>
with v not in h' but conv(S\{v}) a subset of h'.  It follows that
<blockquote>
	h'' := {x | a'&#183;x <= a'&#183;v}
</blockquote>
is a supporting halfspace with v on its bounding plane.  Hence
v is a vertex.
<b>QED</b>


<p>
From this it follows that:

<blockquote>
<b>Lemma</b>.
If P=conv(S) is a polytope, then 
<blockquote>
	vert(P) is a subset of S, and
	P=conv(vert(P)).
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<b>Proof</b>.
Suppose v is a vertex of P; then conv(S\{v}) is not equal to conv(S),
and so v must be in S.

<p>
So vert(P) is a subset of S, and so P=conv(S) contains conv(vert(P)).

<p>
If x is in S but not in vert(P), then conv(S)=conv(S\{x}),
and so by induction on the size of S\vert(P), conv(S)=conv(vert(P)).
<b>QED</b>

<blockquote>
<b>Lemma</b>.
If P is a polyhedron, the intersection of two faces of P is a face of P.
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>Proof</b>.
Suppose f and g are faces, so there are supporting halfspaces 
<blockquote>
	h<sub>f</sub> := {x | a&#183;x <= b}, and<br>
	h<sub>g</sub> := {x | a'&#183;x <= b'}<br>
</blockquote>
whose bounding planes intersect P at f and g.  Clearly the
halfspace
<blockquote>
	h := {x | (a+a')&#183;x <= b+b'},
</blockquote>
has P a subset of h, and for any x in P, 
<blockquote>
	(a+a')&#183;x = b+b'
</blockquote>
only when both
<blockquote>
	a&#183;x = b and a'&#183;x = b';
</blockquote>
hence the intersection of f and g is the intersection of P with the
bounding plane of h, and so is a face.
<b>QED</b>

<blockquote>
<b>Lemma</b>.  Let P be a polyhedron.
If g is in faces(P), and f is in faces(g), then f is in faces(P).
</blockquote>

<b>Proof</b>.
Suppose
<blockquote>
	h<sub>g</sub> := {x | a<sub>g</sub>&#183;x <= b<sub>g</sub>}
</blockquote>
witnesses that g is a face of P: that is, h<sub>g</sub> is supporting and
g is the intersection of h<sub>g</sub> with P.
Suppose
<blockquote>
	h<sub>f</sub> := {x | a<sub>f</sub>&#183;x <= b<sub>f</sub>}
</blockquote>
is a witness that f is a face of g.

<p>
Notice that h<sub>f</sub> does not necessarily
contain P.  Now for value z, consider
<blockquote>
	h<sub>z</sub> := {x | (a<sub>g</sub> + za<sub>f</sub>)x <= b<sub>g</sub> + zb<sub>f</sub>}.
</blockquote>
That is, h<sub>0</sub>=h<sub>g</sub>.
Notice that f is in the bounding plane of h<sub>z</sub>, for any z.

<p>
Suppose P=conv(S<sub>1</sub>)+cone(S<sub>0</sub>).
Now pick z>0, but small enough that all S<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>0</sub> are included in h<sub>z</sub>.
Then P is in h<sub>z</sub>, but the intersection of P with the bounding plane of h<sub>z</sub>
is f.  Hence f is a face of P.
<b>QED</b>


<blockquote>
<b>Corollary</b>.
Let P be a polyhedron.  If g is in faces(P),
then
<blockquote>
	faces(g)={f in faces(P) | f is a subset of g}.
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>Proof</b>.
The previous lemma implies that the faces of g are a subset of the faces of P.

<p>
Suppose f is a face of P that lies in g.  If h witnesses that f is a face
of P, then h also witnesses that f is a face of g.
<b>QED</b>

<p>
In particular, the vertices of f in vert(P) are a subset of the vertices of P,
and so if P=conv(S), then vert(f) is a subset S, and f=conv(f intersect S).

<h3>Faces of Cones</h3>

When v is a vertex of a polyhedron P, cone({v}) is an <i>extreme ray</i>
of C:=cone(lift(P)); that is, cone({v}) is a 1-dimensional face of C.
The set of extreme rays of a cone C is denote extr(C), and it can be shown
that C=cone(extr(C)), which is analogous to P=conv(vert(P)) for a polytope P.

<h3>Faces and lattices</h3>

<p>
We've seen that for a polyhedron P and a,b,c in faces(P):

<blockquote>
	P is a face of P;
	if a is a face of b is a face of c, then a is a face of c.
</blockquote>
and easily:
<blockquote>
	if a is a face of b and b is a face of a, then a=b.
</blockquote>

<p>
That is, the faces can be <i>partially ordered</i> under the "is a face of"
relation.  The fact that the intersection of two faces is a face
implies also that the faces form a mathematical structure called a <i>lattice</i>.

<h3>Faces of Cones</h3>

When v is a vertex of a polyhedron P, cone({v}) is an <i>extreme ray</i>
of C:=cone(lift(P)); that is, cone({v}) is a 1-dimensional face of C.
The set of extreme rays of a cone C is denoted extr(C), and it can be shown
that C=cone(extr(C)), which is analogous to P=conv(vert(P)) for a polytope P.

<h3>Faces, Cones, and Polarity</h3>

<p>
We've seen that the polar of a cone is cone.  There is a fundamental
relation between the faces of a cone C and its polar C<sup>*</sup>.

<p>
Suppose f is a face of C, and h={x | h<sup>*</sup>&#183;x <= 0} is a witness to this.
Since h is supporting, h<sup>*</sup> is a member of C<sup>*</sup>.  Let
f<sup>o</sup> be the subset of C<sup>*</sup> comprising all h<sup>*</sup> for which h is a witness
for f.  That is,
<blockquote>
	f<sup>o</sup> := {y | y&#183;x <0 for all x in C\f, y&#183;x = 0 for all x in f}.
</blockquote>
Moreover,
<blockquote>
	f<sup>o</sup> = {y | y&#183;x <0 for all x in extr(C)\extr(f),
			y&#183;x = 0 for all x in extr(f)},
</blockquote>
and so f<sup>o</sup> is a face of C<sup>*</sup>: it is the intersection of C<sup>*</sup> with the 
a set of planes associated with the vertices of f.

<p>
From the description of f<sup>o</sup>, it's immediate that
<blockquote>
	f is a face of g iff g<sup>o</sup> is a face of f<sup>o</sup>.
</blockquote>

<p>
Is f<sup>o</sup>=f<sup>*</sup>?

What is f<sup>o</sup> if C is given as an intersection of halfspaces?
We suppose for now that f is determined by the bounding planes of
some subset H<sub>f</sub> of H.

<blockquote>
<b>Lemma</b>.
If C=P(H), and f is a face of C given by
<blockquote>
	f = {x | h<sup>*</sup>&#183;x <0 for h in H\H<sub>f</sub>,
		 h<sup>*</sup>&#183;x = 0 for h in H<sub>f</sub>},
</blockquote>
then f<sup>o</sup>=cone(H<sub>f</sub><sup>*</sup>).
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>Proof</b>.  Any member y of H<sub>f</sub><sup>*</sup> has
<blockquote>
	y&#183;x = 0 for all x in f, and<br>
	y&#183;x < 0 for all x in C\f,<br>
</blockquote>
and any positive combinations of such y's preserves these conditions,
so cone(H<sub>f</sub><sup>*</sup>) is a subset of f<sup>o</sup>.

<p>
On the other hand, if y is in f<sup>o</sup>, then y is in cone(H<sup>*</sup>),
so y=sum<sub>h<sup>*</sup> in H<sup>*</sup></sub> c<sub>h</sub> h<sup>*</sup>, with all c<sub>h</sub>>=0.
If c<sub>h</sub>>0 for h<sup>*</sup> not in H<sub>f</sub><sup>*</sup>,
then y&#183;x < 0 for x in f, which cannot happen for y in f<sup>o</sup>.  Hence
y is in cone(H<<sub>f</sub>sup>*</sup>).

Finally:

<blockquote>
<b>Lemma</b>.
If C is a cone and f is a face of C, then f<sup>oo</sup>=f.
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>Proof</b>.  If C=cone(S), and f= cone(S<sub>f</sub>), then
<blockquote>
	f<sup>o</sup> = {y | y&#183;h<sup>*</sup> <0 for all h in (S\S<sub>f</sub>)<sup>*</sup>,
			y&#183;h<sup>*</sup> = 0 for all h in S<sub>f</sub><sup>*</sup>},
</blockquote>
and f<sup>oo</sup> = cone(S<sub>f</sub><sup>**</sup>)= cone(S<sub>f</sub>)=f, using
the previous lemma.
<b>QED</b>

<p>
Thus, the mapping f-->f<sup>o</sup> is a 1-1 correspondence between the faces
of C and the faces of C<sup>*</sup>, and reverses the "is a face of" relation.
