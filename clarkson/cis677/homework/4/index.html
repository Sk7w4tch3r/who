<li> Problem 11.9 of the text.


<li>
Let S be a set of points in E^d, in general position,
so that no d+1 points of S are in a common hyperplane.
Suppose we want to find the vertices of the convex hull of S,
the <em>extreme points</em> of S.

<p>
Consider the following algorithm:

<pre>
E := {};
for each p in S do
	If p is in E, skip it.
	Check if p is in conv(E);
	If p is not in conv(E) then
		use the proof that p is not in conv(E)
			to find v in vert(conv(S))\E, and add v to E.
od;
</pre>

<ol type=a>
<li>
Show that this algorithm can be implemented to run in O(nV) expected time,
where V is the size of vert(conv(S)).  Hint: use linear programming
to find the "proof".

<li> For p in S, define depth(p, S) as 1 if p is an extreme point of S, so
p is in vert(conv(S)),
and otherwise depth(p, S) is 1+depth(p, S\vert(conv(S))).


Show that the depth of every point in S can be computed in O(n<sup>2</sup>)
expected time.

<li>
Given a set H of n hyperplanes, a halfspace h is called <em>irredundant</em>
if P(H) is not equal to P(H\{h}).  Show that a halfspace can be proven
irredundant in O(n) expected time.  Show that the I irredundant halfspaces
of H can be found in O(nI) expected time.

<li> Each irredundant halfspace of H determines a facet of P(H).
Recall that a face of a polyhedron is either a facet, or a face of
a facet.
Show that all F faces of P(H) can be found in O(nF) expected time
and O(n) space.  The "constant factors" in O( ) may be exponential in d.
</ol>

<li> Suppose the convex hull of a set S in general position
is computed using a randomized incremental
algorithm.  The search problem is to find the facets
of conv(R<sub>i</sub>) seen by p<sub>i+1</sub>.
Suppose that for each site p not in R<sub>i</sub>,
a facet of conv(R<sub>i</sub>) seen by p is known.
Show that this information solves the search problem.

<ol type=a>
<li>
Show that
this information can be updated as the algorithm proceeds, such that
the total work done by the algorithm is within a constant factor of
that of the "conflict graph" algorithm described in the text
or the algorithm of Lecture 8.

<li>
How much space does the algorithm need, if the expected number of facets
of conv(R<sub>i</sub>) is some number f<sub>i</sub>?
