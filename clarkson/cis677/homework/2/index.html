<li>	Problem 2.14 of the text.

<li>	Problem 6.2 of the text.

<li>	Problem 6.3 of the text.

<li>	Problem 6.12 of the text.

<li>	Suppose a triangulation with n vertices is given; included
	in this input is the adjacency information of the triangulation.
	A point location data structure for the triangulation can be built
	by building the trapezoidal diagram of its edges using the
	randomized incremental algorithm.
	Show that this data structure can be built in O(n) expected time.

<li>	Let S be a set of line segments in the plane,
	with no three having a common
	crossing point, and no endpoints or crossing points
	with the same y coordinate.
	Let R be a random subset of S of size i.
	For trapezoid T of TD(R), 
	let m<sub>T</sub> be the number of segments of S that meet T.
	Let M be the sum of m<sub>T</sub> over all trapezoids of TD(R).
	Show that the expected value of M is O(n+Ai/n), where A is the
	number of crossing segments of S.  It will be helpful to know
	that the expected number of crossing points is exactly Ai(i-1)/n(n-1).
