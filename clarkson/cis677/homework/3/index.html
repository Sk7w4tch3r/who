<li>
	In Lecture 6, some relations were claimed about the edge sets of some geometric graphs:
<blockquote>
	RNG(S) subset GG(S) subset DG(S).
</blockquote>
Prove these relations.  Given efficient algorithms to compute RNG(S) and GG(S).
(See problems 9.8 and 9.9 of the text for a hint.)

<li>	Problem 7.10 of the text: Let P be a set of n points in the plane.
Give an <i>O(n </i> log <i> n)</i> algorithm to find two points in P that
are closest together. Show that your algorithm is correct.

<li>	Problem 7.11 of the text: Let P be a set of n points in the plane.
Given an <i>O(n </i> log <i> n)</i> time algorithm to find for each point p
in P another point in P that is closest to it.

<li>	Problem 9.3 of the text.

<li>	Use the farthest point Voronoi diagram to show that the smallest
	circle enclosing a set of points can be found in O(n log n) time.

<li>	The <i> discrete 1-center</i> of a set of points S is the
	member of S whose maximum distance to the remaining points of S
	is smallest, over all points of points of S.  That is, cent(S) gives
<blockquote>
	min<sub>p in S</sub> max<sub>q in S-{p}</sub> d(p,q).
</blockquote>
	Show that the discrete 1-center of S can be found in O(n log n) time.
