Abstract:

<P>
  In the first part of the paper, we present an algorithm for the
  construction of a quotient model under the equivalence induced by
  ACTL, the universal fragment of CTL. As this equivalence coincides
  with simulation equivalence, the achieved reduction is better than
  reductions achieved by methods based on bisimulation. Simulation
  equivalence is also the equivalence that is induced by ACTL*,
  hence, the reduced model allows model checking of any ACTL* 
  formula. Furthermore it provides diagnostic information. In the
  second part, we restict our attention to single ACTL* formulae.  An
  algorithm is given that constructs a model which is reduced w.r.t.
  a specific formula.
<P>
  The reduced models are constructed directly, without intermediate
  need for the full models. The approach, splitting of states w.r.t. 
  formulae, yields a sequence of successively more refined models
  which at any stage preserve truth of formulae.
