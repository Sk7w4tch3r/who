Abstract:

<P>
Over the years, the complexity of space missions has dramatically increased with more of the critical aspects of a spacecraft's design being implemented in software. With the added functionality and performance required by the software to meet system requirements, the robustness of the software must be upheld.  Traditional software validation methods of simulation and testing are being stretched to adequately cover the needs of software development in this growing environment.  It is becoming increasingly difficult to establish traditional software validation practices that confidently confirm the robustness of the design in balance with cost and schedule needs of the project.  As a result model checking is emerging as a powerful validation technique for mission critical software.  Model Checking conducts an exhaustive exploration of all possible behaviors of a software system design and as such can be used to detect defects in designs that are typically difficult to discover with conventional testing approaches.
Stateflow® by The Mathworks was used to develop the mission critical Fault
      Protection (FP) flight software (FSW) for NASA's Deep Space 1 (DS1)
      mission.  Demonstrating the trend toward statechart modeling and
      auto-code generation, Stateflow has also been adopted for the FP FSW
      development on NASA's Deep Impact project, scheduled to launch in
      2004.  Both missions share a core component of FSW for which the
      design has been validated using Spin.  Our aim is to validate
      mission-specific components of FSW that are specified using
      statecharts and used in the auto-code generation of the final flight
      code for the mission. We establish an automatic translation procedure
      from Stateflow statecharts to Spin for the validation of the
      mission-specific components.  To guarantee compliance with the
      generated code our translation tool set preserves the Stateflow
      semantics.  We are now able to specify and validate portions of
      mission critical software design and implementation using exhaustive
      exploration techniques.
