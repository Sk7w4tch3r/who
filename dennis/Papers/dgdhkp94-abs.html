Abstract:

<P>
We present a partitioning algorithm for checking ACTL specifications
that distinguishes between states only if this is necessary to ascertain
the specification.
This algorithm is then generalized to also abstract from the variable values
in the states.
Here, too, the values between which the algorithm distinguishes are
determined by what is needed to decide whether or not the specification holds.
The resulting algorithm is being implemented in an ROBDD based model checker
for VHDL/S.
