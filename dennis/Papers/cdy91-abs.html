Abstract:

<P>
  We derive and prove safe an abstract unification algorithm for
  groundness and sharing analysis in logic programs. In general,
  proving the safety of abstract unification plays a crucial role in
  the construction of an abstract interpretation.  We adopt a notion
  of abstract substitutions which is originally due to S&#248ndergaard
  and derive an abstract unification algorithm by abstracting the
  process of unifying a pair of concrete atoms. This results in a
  concise and well motivated definition of abstract unification
  together with a proof of its safety. The resulting algorithm appears
  to formally reconstruct that intended by S&#248ndergaard.  The approach
  followed in deriving the algorithm is interesting in its own; to
  appreciate its advantages it is sufficient to compare our
  presentation of the algorithm with previous ones, and to note that
  those previous are not accompanied by proofs of safety.
