Welcome to my research material page. This site contains papers, talks, as well
as software that I worked on while active as a researcher in wavelets, digital
geometry processing, and wireless MIMO systems in the years 1994-2001.
During this time, I created the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifting_scheme" target="_top">lifting
scheme</a>, a new design and implementation technique for wavelets. The JPEG2000 standard is
based on lifting and lifting is included in the MPEG4 standard.
Lifting also allows for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_generation_wavelet_transform" target="_top">
second generation wavelets</a> which can be adapted to complex geometries. This gave rise to a new
area of research called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry_Processing" target="_top">
Digital Geometry Processing</a>. I also worked on a series of algorithms for differential space
time coding used in MIMO systems today. On this website you can find all the papers I wrote
during this time.
<p>
Since 2001, I have focused on research
management, rather than individual research. Currently I am Vice President
Alcatel<span style='color:purple'>&#8226;</span>Lucent Ventures. In this role I have responsibility
for internal venture selection as well as execution of ventures inside Bell
Labs. The purpose of the ventures is to rapidly and in an enterpreneurial fashion commercialize new innovative technologies out of our labs.
You can find more background on my <a

information on Alcatel<span style='color:purple'>&#8226;</span>Lucent, check
our <a href="http://www.alcatel-lucent.com/" target="_top">website</a>.

Best way to contact me is through email. My email address is my first name
at alcatel-lucent.com.
