<hr size=6>
Cascading (or subdivision) is one of the standard methods to
build wavelets and scaling functions. With this Applet you
can graph all scaling functions and wavelets that satisfy refinement
relations with four coefficients. The scaling function
is defined on [0,3] and satisfies

It is well known that a continuous solution can only exist
in case the refinement coefficients satisfy:
<center>
<b><i>c</i></b><sub>0</sub>
+
<b><i>c</i></b><sub>2</sub>
=
<b><i>c</i></b><sub>1</sub>
+
<b><i>c</i></b><sub>3</sub>
= <b>1</b>.
</center>
This leaves us with two degrees of freedom. We choose them
to be the first coefficient <i>even</i> and the last one
<i>odd</i>. We then have
<center>
<b><i>c</i></b><sub>0</sub> = <b><i>even</i></b>,
<b><i>c</i></b><sub>1</sub> = <b>1</b>-<b><i>odd</i></b>,
<b><i>c</i></b><sub>2</sub> = <b>1</b>-<b><i>even</i></b>,
<b><i>c</i></b><sub>3</sub> = <b><i>odd</i></b>.
</center>
<p>
Several properties of the scaling function immediately follow
from the refinement coefficients:
<ul>
  <li>
      In case <i>even=odd</i>, the scaling function is symmetric
      and the wavelet is anti-symmetric.
  <li> By flipping <i>even</i> and <i>odd</i>, the function
      flips around <i>x</i>=3/2.
  <li>
      In case <i>even (1-even) + odd (1-odd) = 0 </i>, the
      scaling function and wavelet are orthogonal.
      In the <i>(even,odd)</i> plane
      this is a circle which goes trough the corners of the unit
      square.
  <li>
      In case <i>even + odd = 1/2</i>, the order of the scaling
      functions is two, i.e., the scaling function and its translates
      can reproduce linears. In the orthogonal case, the wavelet
      then has two vanishing moments.
  <li>
      In case <i>even</i> or <i>odd</i> is zero, then the support of
      the function is [0,2] or [1,3] respectively. The function then
      also is interpolating in the sense that it takes the value 1 at
      <i>x</i>=1 or <i>x</i>=2 respectively and zero at the other
      integers.
  <li>
      In case 0 &lt; <i>even</i> &lt; 1 and 
      0 &lt; <i>odd</i> &lt; 1, i.e., the red dot is in the unit
      square, the cascade algorithm will only use convex combinations.
      As a result the scaling function will only take on values
      between 0 and 1, while the wavelet only takes values between -1
      and 1.
  <li>
      A lot of research has been done on how the smoothness of the
      scaling function depends on the refinements coefficients.  In
      fact the cascade algorithm is an instance of a 1D subdivision
      algorithm. For a fixed length, the smoothest solution is always
      the B-spline. Colella and Heil study the four coefficient case
      in detail and are able to outline the area in the
      <i>(even,odd)</i> plane where the scaling function is
      continuous. This area is draw shaded in light gray.  For more
      information, check D. Colella and C. Heil, Characterizations of
      scaling functions: Continuous Solutions, <i>SIAM J. Matrix
      Anal. Appl.</i>, vol. 15, pp. 496-518, 1994. The idea for
      this applet is partly inspired by their work. Special
      thanks to Chris Heil for providing the polygon outlining the
      area of continuity.
</ul>
Several well-known functions are part of this class.
<ul>
  <li>
      If <i>even = 1</i> and <i>odd = 0</i>, then the scaling function
      is a box function which is one on the interval [0,1] and zero
      elsewhere. Box functions on [1,2] and [2,3] have respectively
      <i>even = odd = 0</i> and <i>even = 0</i> and <i>odd = 1</i>.
      The box functions are orthogonal and lie on 3 of the corners
      of the unit square. These are the only scaling functions that
      are orthogonal and symmetric.
      A box scaling function leads to a Haar wavelet. 
  <li>
      If <i>even = 1/2</i> and <i>odd = 0</i> the refinement coeffients
      are [1/2 1 1/2 0], and the scaling function is a hat function (linear
      B-spline).
  <li>
      If <i>even = odd = 1/4</i> 
      the refinement coefficients are [1/4 3/4 3/4 1/4] and the
      scaling function
      is a quadratic B-spline. The quadratic B-spline has order 3.
   <li>
      If <i>even = </i>
      <applet codebase=../bin code="WebEQ.class" height=16 width=65
       align=bottom> 
      <param name=size value=15>
      <param name=color value=0xffffff>
      <param name=line1 value= "(1 + <sqrt>3</sqrt>) / 4">
      (3 - sqrt(3))/4
      </applet>
      and <i>odd = 1/2 - even</i>, you get 
      the Daubechies D4 orthogonal scaling function and wavelet. This
      and its flipped version are the only solutions which are orthogonal
      and have order 2.
   <li>
      If <i>even = odd = 1</i>, the cascade algorithm diverges.
      However, in a weak (distributional) sense, it converges
      and the scaling function is 1/3 times the indicator function on [0,3].
