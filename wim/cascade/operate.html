<h2 align=center> How to Operate the Applet</h2>
<hr size=6>
This Applet graphs scaling functions and wavelets
with two parameters <i>even</i>
and <i>odd</i>. If you are interested, check the
<a href="math.html">mathematics behind the Applet</a>. The applet
shows the graph of the scaling function or wavelet,
which is defined on [0,3], on
top and the parameter space below. The circle and lines in the
parameter space have a specific meaning which you can find in
<a href="math.html">the mathematical background</a>. The red dot
indicates the current value of the parameters. 
<p>
You probably already figured out that:
<ul>
  <li> You can use the slide bar to set the number of iterations of
  the algorithm. Use it to find  a compromise between quality of
      the graph and speed (6 works best for me).
  <li> You can move the red dot in parameter space. In fact, you
       can even move it outside the paremeter space.
  <li> The <i>Mirror</i> button flips the function.
  <li> The <i>History</i> radio button allows you to trace the
  execution of the program. This originally was a bug in the program, but I now
  added it as an option as one can make
      pretty pictures with it.  How about <a
      href="bat.gif">this </a> as a <i>multi wavelet</i> ;-)
      Clicking <i>History</i> again clears the screan.
      By switching history on and changing the level, you can
      check the convergence speed of the algorithm. The smoother
      the limit function, the faster the convergence.
  <li> The buttons below give you well known functions.
  <li> The buttons on the left allow you to switch between wavelet
       and scaling function.
  <li> You only get smooth graphs inside the shaded region.
      The closer to the upper right corner (1,1), the more fractal
      the function becomes.
  <li> Using the buttons on the bottom left, you can switch between
       piecewise linear and piecewise constant drawing. Linear
      is best when drawing smooth functions, while constant is
      better while outside the region of continuity. With constant
      drawing you can see how the function almost falls into two
      pieces around the point (1,1). (Try it with the symmetric
      constraint on.)
  <li> You can contrain the parameter space using the buttons on
       the right. See if you can converge to the Daubechies by
       alternating the orthogonality and order 2 constraints.
</ul>
<p>
Some notes on the implementation:
<ul>
  <li> The Applet uses double buffering to avoid flicker both for
       the graph and the parameter space.
  <li> The Applet is fully resizable, so if you would like a larger
       canvas, simply adjust the HEIGHT and WIDTH of the APPLET tag.
  <li> The Applet does not rely on garbadge collection and
        will never increase memory after initialization.
  <li> In order to increase speed while dragging the mouse,
      only every other mouse position is read.
</ul>
