<h3> PhD Thesis: Construction and Application of Wavelets in Numerical Analysis
</h3>

<b>Abstract:</b>
Wavelets are a new family of basis functions that can be used to
approximate general functions. They combine powerful properties such
as (bi)orthogonality, compact support, localization in time and
frequency, and fast algorithms.  This thesis investigates the use of
wavelets in numerical analysis problems. In the first part we
construct two basic tools, quadrature formulae and asymptotic error
expansions.  The former provides an easy way to calculate the wavelet
coefficients, while the latter allows a simple comparison of different
wavelet families.  In the second part, we construct and study wavelets
adapted to a weighted inner product.  We show how one can use those
wavelets for the rapid solution of ordinary differential equations.
Finally, we study smooth local trigonometric functions, which can be
seen as the Fourier transform of wavelets.  We generalize their
construction to the biorthogonal case, and show how to use them in
data compression algorithms.  This is illustrated with examples
concerning image compression.
