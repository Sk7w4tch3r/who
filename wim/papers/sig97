<br><b>Figure 1:</b>
Before the Armadillo started working out he was flabby,
complete with a double chin. Now he exercises regularly. The original
is on the right (courtesy Venkat Krischnamurthy). The edited version
on the left illustrates large
scale edits, such as his belly, and smaller scale edits such as his
double chin; all edits were performed at about 5 frames per second on
an Indigo R10000 Solid Impact.

<br><b>Figure 2:</b>
What used to be a patch is best treated as a mesh when adding
fine detail.

<br><b>Figure 4:</b>
Subdivision describes a smooth surface as the limit
of a sequence of refined polyhedra. The meshes show several levels
of an adaptive Loop surface generated by our system (Dataset,

<br><b>Figure 11:</b>
Analysis propagates the changes on finer levels to coarser
levels, keeping the magnitude of details under control. 
Left: The initial mesh. Center: A simple edit on level 3. Right: The 
effect of the edit on level 2. A significant part of the change was 
absorbed by higher level details.

<br><b>Figure 15:</b>
On the left are two meshes  which are uniformly subdivided and
consist of 11k (upper) and 9k (lower)  triangles. 
On the right another pair of meshes mesh with  approximately 
the same numbers  of triangles. Upper and lower pairs of meshes
are generated  from the same original data but the right meshes
were  optimized through
suitable choice of epsilon. See the color plates for a
comparison between the two under shading.

<br><b>Figure 16:</b>
It is easy to change epsilon locally. Here a lens
was applied to the right eye of the Mannequin head with decreasing
epsilon to force very fine resolution of the mesh around the
eye.
