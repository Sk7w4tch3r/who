<b>Abstract:</b> We generalize basic signal processing tools such as
  downsampling, upsampling, and filters to irregular connectivity 3D
  triangular meshes. This is accomplished through the design of a
  non-uniform relaxation procedure whose weights depend on the
  geometry and we show its superiority over existing schemes whose
  weights only depend on connectivity.  This is combined with known
  mesh simplification methods to build subdivision, pyramid, and
  wavelet algorithms. We demonstrate the power of these algorithms
  through a number of application examples including smoothing,
  enhancement, editing, and texture mapping.
