<b>Abstract:</b>
We present a framework for differential modulation with multiple antennas
across a continuously fading channel, where neither the transmitter nor the
receiver knows the fading coefficients.  The framework can be seen as a
natural extension of standard differential phase shift keying (DPSK)
commonly used in single-antenna unknown-channel systems. We show how our
differential framework links the unknown-channel system with a
known-channel system.  As a special case, we introduce a class of diagonal
signals where only one antenna is active at any time, and show how these
signals may be used to achieve full transmitter diversity and low
probability of error.

May 2000:
<td align=left valign=top><font size=2 face=Helvetica>
The paper is accepted for publication in IEEE Trans. Comm.
Some very minor changes were made.

February 2000:
<td align=left valign=top><font size=2 face=Helvetica>
We posted a revised version
of the paper based on referees comments.
We use a slightly different normalization in Sections 2.2 and 2.3.

October 1999:
<td align=left valign=top><font size=2 face=Helvetica>
We posted a revised version
of the paper. The main difference is a revised definition 
of the <i>diversity product</i> &zeta;; the new definition
is the square root of the old one. This way the diversity product
is more amenable to interpretation in the known channel case.
