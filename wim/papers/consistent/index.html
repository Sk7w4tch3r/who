    "When given a set of head models an obvious shape to compute is their average. In general the connectivity and sampling patterns of the models are different and computing the average is non trivial. After computing consistent mesh parameterizations (red patch boundaries) and remeshing, all models have the same connectivity and sampling pattern so computing the average becomes trivial.">

<b>Abstract:</b>
  A basic element of Digital Geometry Processing algorithms is the
  establishment of a smooth parameterization for a given model.  In
  this paper we propose an algorithm which establishes 
  parameterizations for a set of models.
  The parameterizations are called consistent because they share the
  same base domain and respect features. They give immediate
  correspondences between models and allow remeshes with the same
  connectivity.  Such remeshes form the basis for a large class of
  algorithms, including principal component analysis, wavelet
  transforms, detail and texture transfer between models, and
  <i>n</i>-way shape blending.  We demonstrate the versatility of our
  algorithm with a number of examples.
