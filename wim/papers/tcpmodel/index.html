<b>Abstract:</b>
  We propose a two level model for TCP connection arrivals
  in local area networks.  The first
  level are user sessions whose arrival is time-varying Poisson. The
  second level are connections within a user session.  Their number
  and mean interarrival are independent and biPareto across user
  session.  The interarrivals within a user session are Weibull,
  and across all users are correlated Weibull. Our
  model has a small number of parameters which are inferred from
  real traffic collected a a firewall. We show that traffic
  synthesized with our model closely characterizes the original data.
