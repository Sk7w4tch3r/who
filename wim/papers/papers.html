<h3>Nonlinear wavelet transform for image coding</h3>
<b>Authors:</b>
   R. Claypoole, G. Davis, W. Sweldens, and R. Baraniuk
<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>
  We examine the central issues of invertibility, stability,
  artifacts, and frequency-domain characteristics in the construction
  of non-linear analogs of the wavelet transform.  The lifting
  framework for wavelet construction motivates our analysis and
  provides new insight into the problem.  We describe a new type of
  non-linearity for use in constructing non-linear transforms: a set
  of linear predictors that are chosen adaptively using a non-linear
  selection function.  We also describe how earlier families of
  non-linear filter banks can be extended through the use of
  prediction functions operating on a causal neighborhood.  We present
  preliminary results for a synthetic test image.

<h3>Losless Image Compression using Integer to Integer Wavelet Transforms</h3>
<b>Authors:</b>
   R. C. Calderbank, Ingrid Daubechies, Wim Sweldens, and Boon-Lock Yeo
<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>
   Invertible wavelet transforms that map integers to integers are
   important for lossless representations. In this paper, we present an
   approach to build integer to integer wavelet transforms based up on
   the idea of factoring wavelet transforms into lifting steps. This
   allows the construction of an integer version of every wavelet
   transform. We demonstrate the use of these transforms in lossless
   image compression.

<h3>Regularity of Irregular Subdivision</h3>
<b>Authors:</b>
   Ingrid Daubechies, Igor Guskov, and Wim Sweldens
<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>
  We study the smoothness of the limit function for one dimensional
  unequally spaced interpolating subdivision schemes. The new grid
  points introduced at every level can lie in irregularly spaced
  locations between old, adjacent grid points and not only
  midway as is usually the case. For the natural generalization of
  the four point scheme introduced by Dubuc and Dyn, Levin, and
  Gregory, we show that, under some geometric restrictions, the limit
  function is always C<sup>1</sup>; under slightly stronger restrictions
  we show that the limit function is almost C<sup>2</sup>, the same regularity
  as in the regularly spaced case.

<h3>Interactive Multiresolution Mesh Editing</h3>
<b>Authors:</b> Denis Zorin, Peter Schr&ouml;der, and Wim Sweldens
<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>
We describe a multiresolution representation for meshes based on
subdivision. Subdivision is a natural extension of the existing
patch-based surface representations. At the same time subdivision
algorithms can be viewed as operating directly on polygonal meshes,
which makes them a useful tool for mesh manipulation.  Combination of
subdivision and smoothing algorithms of Taubin allows us to construct
a set of algorithms for interactive multiresolution editing of complex
meshes of arbitrary topology. Simplicity of the essential algorithms
for refinement and coarsification allows to make them local and
adaptive, considerably improving their efficiency. We have built a
scalable interactive multiresolution editing system based on such
algorithms.

<h3>Wavelet Transforms that Map Integers to Integers</h3>
<b>Authors:</b>
   R. C. Calderbank, Ingrid Daubechies, Wim Sweldens, and Boon-Lock Yeo
<p>
<b>Abstract:</b> Invertible wavelet transforms that map integers to
  integers have important applications in lossless coding. In this
  paper we present two approaches to build integer to integer wavelet
  transforms.  The first approach is to adapt the precoder of Laroia
  et al., which is used in information transmission; we combine it
  with expansion factors for the high and low pass band in subband
  filtering.  The second approach builds upon the idea of factoring
  wavelet transforms into so-called lifting steps. This allows the
  construction of an integer version of every wavelet transform.
  Finally, we use these approaches in a lossless image coder and
  compare the results to the literature.

<h3>LIFTPACK: A Software Package for Wavelet Transforms using Lifting</h3>
<b>Authors:</b> Gabriel Fern&aacute;ndez, Senthil Periaswamy, and Wim Sweldens
<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>
   We present LIFTPACK: A software package written in C for fast
   calculation of 2D biorthogonal wavelet transforms using the lifting
   scheme. The lifting scheme is a new approach for the construction
   of <i>biorthogonal wavelets</i> entirely in the spatial domain,
   i.e., independent of the Fourier Transform. Constructing wavelets
   using lifting consists of three simple phases: the first step or
   Lazy wavelet <i>splits</i> the data into two subsets, even and
   odd, the second step calculates the wavelet coefficients (high
   pass) as the failure to <i>predict</i> the odd set based on the
   even, and finally the third step <i>updates</i> the even set using
   the wavelet coefficients to compute the scaling function
   coefficients (low pass). The predict phase ensures polynomial
   cancelation in the high pass (vanishing moments of the dual
   wavelet) and the update phase ensures preservation of moments in
   the low pass (vanishing moments of the primal wavelet). By varying
   the order, an entire family of transforms can be built.  The
   lifting scheme ensures fast calculation of the forward and inverse
   wavelet transforms that only involve FIR filters.  The transform
   works for images of arbitrary size with correct treatment of the
   boundaries. Also, all computations can be done in-place.

<h3>Interpolating Subdivision for Meshes with Arbitrary Topology</h3>
<b>Authors:</b> Denis Zorin, Peter Schr&ouml;der, and Wim Sweldens
<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>
  Subdivision is a powerful paradigm for the generation of surfaces of
  arbitrary topology. Given an initial triangular mesh the goal is to
  produce a smooth and visually pleasing surface, whose shape is
  controlled by the initial mesh. Of particular interest are
  interpolating schemes since they match the original data exactly,
  and are crucial for fast multiresolution and wavelet techniques.
  Dyn, Gregory, and Levin introduced the Butterfly
  scheme, which is known to yield C1 surfaces in
  the topologically regular setting. Unfortunately it exhibits various
  degeneracies in case of an irregular topology, leading to
  undesirable artifacts.  We examine these failures and derive an
  improved scheme, which retains the simplicity of the Butterfly
  scheme, is interpolating, and results in smoother surfaces.

<h3> The Lifting Scheme: A new philosophy in biorthogonal
              wavelet constructions
</h3>
<b>Authors:</b> Wim Sweldens
<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>
In this paper we present the basic idea behind the lifting scheme, a
new construction of biorthogonal wavelets which does not use the
Fourier transform. In contrast with earlier papers we introduce
lifting purely from a wavelet transform point of view and only
consider the wavelet basis functions in a later stage.  We show how
lifting leads to a faster, fully in-place implementation of the
wavelet transform. Moreover, it can be used in the construction of
second generation wavelets, wavelets that are not necessarily
translates and dilates of one function. A typical example of the
latter are wavelets on the sphere.

<h3> Spherical Wavelets: Texture Processing
</h3>
<b>Authors:</b> Peter Schr&ouml;der and Wim Sweldens
<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>
Wavelets are a powerful tool for planar image processing.  The
resulting algorithms are straightforward, fast, and efficient.  With
the recently developed spherical wavelets this framework can be
transposed to spherical textures.  We describe a class of processing
operators which are diagonal in the wavelet basis and which can be
used for smoothing and enhancement.  Since the wavelets (filters) are
local in space and frequency, complex localized constraints and
spatially varying characteristics can be incorporated easily. Examples
from environment mapping and the manipulation of topography/bathymetry
data are given.

<h3> A new class of unbalanced Haar wavelets that form an
     unconditional basis for Lp on general measure spaces
</h3>
<b>Authors:</b> Maria Girardi and Wim Sweldens
<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>
Given a complete separable sigma-finite measure space (X,Sigma,mu) and
nested partitions of X, we construct unbalanced Haar-like wavelets on
X that form an unconditional basis for Lp(X,Sigma,mu) where 1 &lt p &lt
infinity.  Our construction and proofs build upon ideas of Burkholder
and Mitrea.  We show that if (X,Sigma,mu) is not purely atomic, then
the unconditional basis constant of our basis is (max(p,q)-1).  We
derive a fast algorithm to compute the coefficients.

<b>Abstract:</b>
Wavelets have proven to be powerful bases for use in numerical
analysis and signal processing.  Their power lies in the fact that
they only require a small number of coefficients to represent general
functions and large data sets accurately.  This allows compression and
efficient computations.  Classical constructions have been limited to
simple domains such as intervals and rectangles.  In this paper we
present a wavelet construction for scalar functions defined on the
sphere.  We show how biorthogonal wavelets with custom properties can
be constructed with the lifting scheme. The bases are extremely easy
to implement and allofw fully adaptive subdivisions. We give examples
of functions defined on the sphere, such as topographic data,
bi-directional reflection distribution functions, and illumination,
and show how they can be efficiently represented with spherical
wavelets.

<h3> The lifting scheme:  A custom-design construction of
              biorthogonal wavelets
</h3>
<b>Authors:</b> Wim Sweldens
<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>
We present the lifting scheme, a new idea of constructing compactly
supported wavelets with compactly supported duals.  The lifting scheme
provides a simple relationship between all multiresolution analyses
with the same scaling function. It isolates the degrees of freedom
remaining after fixing the biorthogonality relations.  Then one has
full control over these degrees of freedom to custom-design the
wavelet for a particular application. It also leads to a faster
implementation of the fast wavelet transform.  We illustrate the use
of the lifting scheme in the construction of wavelets with
interpolating scaling functions.

<h3>  Biorthogonal smooth local trigonometric bases
</h3>
<b>Authors:</b> Bj&ouml;rn Jawerth and Wim Sweldens
<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>
In this paper we discuss smooth local trigonometric bases.  We present
two generalizations of the orthogonal basis of Malvar and
Coifman-Meyer: biorthogonal and equal parity bases.  These allow
natural representations of constant and, sometimes, linear components.
We study and compare their approximation properties and applicability
in data compression. This is illustrated with numerical examples.

<h3> Signal Compression with Smooth Local Trigonometric Bases
</h3>
<b>Authors:</b> Bj&ouml;rn Jawerth and Yi Liu and Wim Sweldens
<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>
We discuss smooth local trigonometric bases and their applications to
signal compression.  In image compression, these bases can reduce the
blocking effect that occurs in JPEG.  We present and compare two
generalizations of the original construction of Malvar, Coifman and
Meyer: biorthogonal and equal parity bases.  These have the advantage
that constant and linear components, respectively, can be represented
efficiently. We show how they reduce blocking effects and improve the
signal to noise ratio.

<h3> Wavelet Multiresolution Analysis adapted for
              the Fast Solution of Boundary Value Ordinary Equations
</h3>
<b>Authors:</b> Bj&ouml;rn Jawerth and Wim Sweldens)
<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>
We present ideas on how to use wavelets in the solution of boundary
value ordinary differential equations. Rather than using classical
wavelets, we adapt their construction so that they become
(bi)orthogonal with respect to the inner product defined by the
operator. The stiffness matrix in a Galerkin method then becomes
diagonal and can thus be trivially inverted. We show how one can
construct an O(N) algorithm for various constant and variable
coefficient operators.

<h3>
     Asymptotic Error Expansion of Wavelet Approximations of Smooth
     Functions II
</h3>
<p>
<b>Authors:</b> Wim Sweldens and Robert Piessens
<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>
This paper deals with asymptotic error expansions of orthogonal
wavelet approximations of smooth functions.  Two formulae are derived
and compared.  As already known, the error decays as O(2^(-jN))$ where
j is the multiresolution level and $N$ is the number of vanishing
wavelet moments.  It is shown that the most significant term of the
error expansion is proportional to the N-th derivative of the function
multiplied with an oscillating function.  This result is used to
derive asymptotic interpolating properties of the wavelet
approximation.  Also a numerical extrapolation scheme based on the
multiresolution analysis is presented.

<h3>
   An Overview of Wavelet Based Multiresolution Analysis
</h3>
<b>Authors:</b> Bj&ouml;rn Jawerth and Wim Sweldens)
<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>
In this paper we present an overview of wavelet based multiresolution
analyses.  First, we briefly discuss the continuous wavelet transform
in its simplest form.  Then, we give the definition of a
multiresolution analysis and show how wavelets fit into it. We take a
closer look at orthogonal, biorthogonal and semiorthogonal wavelets.
The fast wavelet transform, wavelets on an interval, multidimensional
wavelets and wavelet packets are discussed.  Several examples of
wavelet families are introduced and compared.  Finally, the essentials
of two major applications are outlined: data compression and
compression of linear operators.

<h3>
   Quadrature Formulae and Asymptotic Error Expansions for Wavelet
   Approximations of Smooth Functions
</h3>
<b>Authors:</b> Wim Sweldens and Robert Piessens
<p>
<b>Abstract:</b>
In many applications concerning wavelets, inner products of functions
f(x) with wavelets and scaling functions have to be calculated.  This
paper involves the calculation of these inner products from function
evaluations of f(x).  Firstly, one point quadrature formulae are
presented. Their accuracy is compared for different classes of
wavelets.  Therefore the relationship between the scaling function
phi(x), its values at the integers and the scaling parameters h_k is
investigated.  Secondly, multiple point quadrature formulae are
constructed.  A method to solve the nonlinear system coming from this
construction is presented.  Since the construction of multiple point
formulae using monomials is ill-conditioned, a modified,
well-conditioned construction using Chebyshev polynomials is
presented.
