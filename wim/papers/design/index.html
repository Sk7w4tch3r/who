<b>Abstract:</b>
Multiple antennas can greatly increase the data rate and reliability of a
wireless communication link in a fading environment, but the practical
success of using multiple antennas depends crucially on our ability to
design high-rate space-time constellations with low encoding and decoding
complexity.  It has been shown that full transmitter diversity, where the
constellation is a set of unitary matrices whose differences have nonzero
determinant, is a desirable property for good performance.

We use the powerful theory of fixed-point-free groups and their
representations to design high-rate constellations with full
diversity.  Furthermore, we thereby classify all full-diversity
constellations that form a group, for all rates and numbers of
transmitter antennas.  The group structure makes the constellations
especially suitable for differential modulation and low-complexity
decoding algorithms.

The classification also reveals that the number of different
group-structures with full diversity is very limited when the number
of transmitter antennas is large and odd.  We therefore also consider
extensions of the constellation designs to nongroups.  We conclude by
showing that many of our designed constellations perform excellently
on both simulated and real wireless channels.
