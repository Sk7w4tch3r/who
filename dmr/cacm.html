<H4>I. INTRODUCTION
</H4>
<P>
There have been four versions of
the
Unix time-sharing system.
 12
The earliest (circa 1969-70) ran on
the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-7 and -9 computers.
The second version ran on the unprotected
PDP-11/20 computer.
The third incorporated multiprogramming and ran
on the PDP-11/34, /40, /45, /60, and /70 computers;
it is the one described in the previously published version
of this paper, and is also the most widely used today.
This paper describes only the
fourth, current
system that runs on the PDP-11/70 and the
Interdata 8/32 computers.
In fact, the differences among the various systems is
rather small;
most of the revisions made to the originally published version of this
paper,
aside from those concerned with style,
had to do with details of the implementation of the file system.
</P>
<P>
Since
PDP-11
Unix became operational
in February, 1971,
over 600 installations have been put into service.
Most of them are engaged in applications such as
computer science education,
the preparation and formatting of documents
and other textual material,
the collection and processing of trouble data
from various switching machines within the Bell System,
and recording and checking telephone service
orders.
Our own installation is used mainly for research
in operating systems, languages,
computer networks,
and other topics in computer science, and also for
document preparation.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most important achievement of
Unix
is to demonstrate
that
a powerful operating system for interactive use
need not be expensive either in equipment or in human
effort:
it
can run on hardware costing as little as $40,000, and
less than two man-years were spent on the main system
software.
We hope, however, that users find
that the
most important characteristics of the system
are its simplicity, elegance, and ease of use.
</P>
<P>
Besides the operating system proper, some major programs
available under
Unix
are
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
C compiler
Text editor based on QED[1];
Assembler, linking loader, symbolic debugger
Phototypesetting and equation setting programs[2, 3]
</PRE></TT></DL>
<br>
Dozens of languages including
Fortran 77, Basic, Snobol, APL, Algol 68, M6, TMG, Pascal
There is a host of maintenance, utility, recreation and novelty programs,
all written locally.
The
Unix
user community, which numbers in the thousands,
has contributed many more programs and languages.
It is worth noting that the system is totally self-supporting.
All
Unix
software is maintained on
the
system;
likewise, this paper and all other
documents
in this issue
were generated and formatted by the
Unix
editor and text formatting
programs.
</P>
<H4>II. HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE ENVIRONMENT
</H4>
<P>
The PDP-11/70 on which the Research
Unix
system is installed is a 16-bit
word (8-bit byte) computer with 768K bytes of core memory;
the system kernel
occupies 90K bytes
about equally divided between code
and data tables.
This system, however, includes a very large number of
device drivers
and enjoys a generous allotment
of space for I/O buffers and system tables;
a minimal system capable of running the software
mentioned above can
require as little as 96K bytes
of core altogether.
There are even larger installations;
see the description of the
PWB/UNIX systems [4, 5],
for example.
There are also much smaller, though somewhat restricted,
versions of the system [6].
</P>
<P>
Our own PDP-11 has two
200-Mb moving-head disks
for file system storage and swapping.
There are 20 variable-speed
communications interfaces
attached to 300- and 1200-baud data sets,
and an additional 12 communication lines
hard-wired to 9600-baud terminals and
satellite computers.
There are also several 2400- and 4800-baud
synchronous communication interfaces
used for machine-to-machine file transfer.
Finally, there is a variety
of miscellaneous
devices including
nine-track magnetic tape,
a line printer,
a voice synthesizer,
a phototypesetter,
a digital switching network,
and a chess machine.
</P>
<P>
The preponderance of
Unix
software is written in the
abovementioned C language [7].
Early versions of the operating system were written in assembly language,
but during the summer of 1973, it was rewritten in C.
The size of the new system was about one-third greater
than that of the old.
Since the new system not only became much easier to
understand and to modify but also
included
many functional improvements,
including multiprogramming and the ability to
share reentrant code among several user programs,
we consider this increase in size quite acceptable.
</P>
<H4>III. THE FILE SYSTEM
</H4>
<P>
The most important role of
the system
is to provide
a file system.
From the point of view of the user, there
are three kinds of files: ordinary disk files,
directories, and special files.
</P>
<H4>3.1 Ordinary files
</H4>
<P>
A file
contains whatever information the user places on it,
for example, symbolic or binary
(object) programs.
No particular structuring is expected by the system.
A file of text consists simply of a string
of characters, with lines demarcated by the newline character.
Binary programs are sequences of words as
they will appear in core memory when the program
starts executing.
A few user programs manipulate files with more
structure;
for example, the assembler generates, and the loader
expects, an object file in a particular format.
However,
the structure of files is controlled by
the programs that use them, not by the system.
</P>
<H4>3.2 Directories
</H4>
<P>
Directories provide
the mapping between the names of files
and the files themselves, and thus
induce a structure on the file system as a whole.
Each user has a directory of his own files;
he may also create subdirectories to contain
groups of files conveniently treated together.
A directory behaves exactly like an ordinary file except that it
cannot be written on by unprivileged programs, so that the system
controls the contents of directories.
However, anyone with
appropriate permission may read a directory just like any other file.
</P>
<P>
The system maintains several directories
for its own use.
One of these is the
<I>root</I>
directory.
All files in the system can be found by tracing
a path through a chain of directories
until the desired file is reached.
The starting point for such searches is often the
<I>root</I>.
Other system directories contain all the programs provided
for general use; that is, all the
<B>commands</B>.
As will be seen, however, it is by no means necessary
that a program reside in one of these directories for it
to be executed.
</P>
<P>
Files are named by sequences of 14 or
fewer characters.
When the name of a file is specified to the
system, it may be in the form of a
<B>path</B>
<B>name</B>,
which
is a sequence of directory names separated by slashes, ``/'',
and ending in a file name.
If the sequence begins with a slash, the search begins in the
root directory.
The name
<I>/alpha/beta/gamma</I>
causes the system to search
the root for directory
<I>alpha</I>,
then to search
<I>alpha</I>
for
<I>beta</I>,
finally to find
<I>gamma</I>
in
<I>beta</I>.
<I>gamma</I>
may be an ordinary file, a directory, or a special
file.
As a limiting case, the name ``/'' refers to the root itself.
</P>
<P>
A path name not starting with ``/'' causes the system to begin the
search in the user's current directory.
Thus, the name
<I>alpha/beta</I>
specifies the file named
<I>beta</I>
in
subdirectory
<I>alpha</I>
of the current
directory.
The simplest kind of name, for example,
<I>alpha</I>,
refers to a file that itself is found in the current
directory.
As another limiting case, the null file name refers
to the current directory.
</P>
<P>
The same non-directory file may appear in several directories under
possibly different names.
This feature is called
<B>linking</B>;
a directory entry for a file is sometimes called a link.
The
Unix
system
differs from other systems in which linking is permitted
in that all links to a file have equal status.
That is, a file does not exist within a particular directory;
the directory entry for a file consists merely
of its name and a pointer to the information actually
describing the file.
Thus a file exists independently of any
directory entry, although in practice a file is made to
disappear along with the last link to it.
</P>
<P>
Each directory always has at least two entries.
The name
``<B>.</B>'' in each directory refers to the directory itself.
Thus a program
may read the current directory under the name ``<B>.</B>'' without knowing
its complete path name.
The name ``<B>..</B>'' by convention refers to the parent of the
directory in which it appears, that is, to the directory in which
it was created.
</P>
<P>
The directory structure is constrained to have the form
of a rooted tree.
Except for the special entries ``<B>.</B>'' and ``<B>..</B>'', each directory
must appear as an entry in exactly one other directory, which is its
parent.
The reason for this is to simplify the writing of programs
that visit subtrees of the directory structure, and more
important, to avoid the separation of portions of the hierarchy.
If arbitrary links to directories were permitted, it would
be quite difficult to detect when the last connection from
the root to a directory was severed.
</P>
<H4>3.3 Special files
</H4>
<P>
Special files constitute the most unusual feature of the
Unix
file system.
Each supported I/O device
is associated with at least one such file.
Special files are read and written just like ordinary
disk files, but requests to read or write result in activation of the associated
device.
An entry for each special file resides in directory
<I>/dev</I>,
although a link may be made to one of these files
just as it may to an ordinary file.
Thus, for example,
to write on a magnetic tape
one may write on the file
<I>/dev/mt</I>.
Special files exist for each communication line, each disk,
each tape drive,
and for physical main memory.
Of course,
the active disks
and the memory special file are protected from
indiscriminate access.
</P>
<P>
There is a threefold advantage in treating
I/O devices this way:
file and device I/O
are as similar as possible;
file and device names have the same
syntax and meaning, so that
a program expecting a file name
as a parameter can be passed a device
name; finally,
special files are subject to the same
protection mechanism as regular files.
</P>
<H4>3.4 Removable file systems
</H4>
<P>
Although the root of the file system is always stored on the same
device,
it is not necessary that the entire file system hierarchy
reside on this device.
There is a
<I>mount</I>
system request with two arguments:
the name of an existing ordinary file, and the name of a special
file whose associated
storage volume (e.g., a disk pack) should have the structure
of an independent file system
containing its own directory hierarchy.
The effect of
<I>mount</I>
is to cause
references to the heretofore ordinary file
to refer instead to the root directory
of the file system on the removable volume.
In effect,
<I>mount</I>
replaces a leaf of the hierarchy tree (the ordinary file)
by a whole new subtree (the hierarchy stored on the
removable volume).
After the
<I>mount</I>,
there is virtually no distinction
between files on the removable volume and those in the
permanent file system.
In our installation, for example,
the root directory resides
on a small partition of one of
our disk drives,
while the other drive,
which contains the user's files,
is mounted by the system initialization
sequence.
A mountable file system is generated by
writing on its corresponding special file.
A utility program is available to create
an empty file system,
or one may simply copy an existing file system.
</P>
<P>
There is only one exception to the rule of identical
treatment of files on different devices:
no link may exist between one file system hierarchy and
another.
This restriction is enforced so as to avoid
the elaborate bookkeeping
that would otherwise be required to assure removal of the links
whenever the removable volume is dismounted.
</P>
<H4>3.5 Protection
</H4>
<P>
Although the access control scheme
is quite simple, it has some unusual features.
Each user of the system is assigned a unique
user identification number.
When a file is created, it is marked with
the user ID of its owner.
Also given for new files
is a set of ten protection bits.
Nine of these specify
independently read, write, and execute permission
for the
owner of the file,
for other members of his group,
and for all remaining users.
</P>
<P>
If the tenth bit is on, the system
will temporarily change the user identification
(hereafter, user ID)
of the current user to that of the creator of the file whenever
the file is executed as a program.
This change in user ID is effective only
during the execution of the program that calls for it.
The set-user-ID feature provides
for privileged programs that may use files
inaccessible to other users.
For example, a program may keep an accounting file
that should neither be read nor changed
except by the program itself.
If the set-user-ID bit is on for the
program, it may access the file although
this access might be forbidden to other programs
invoked by the given program's user.
Since the actual user ID
of the invoker of any program
is always available,
set-user-ID programs
may take any measures desired to satisfy themselves
as to their invoker's credentials.
This mechanism is used to allow users to execute
the carefully written
commands
that call privileged system entries.
For example, there is a system entry
invokable only by the ``super-user'' (below)
that creates
an empty directory.
As indicated above, directories are expected to
have entries for ``<B>.</B>'' and ``<B>..</B>''.
The command which creates a directory
is owned by the super-user
and has the set-user-ID bit set.
After it checks its invoker's authorization to
create the specified directory,
it creates it and makes the entries
for ``<B>.</B>'' and ``<B>..</B>''.
</P>
<P>
Because anyone may set the set-user-ID
bit on one of his own files,
this mechanism is generally
available without administrative intervention.
For example,
this protection scheme easily solves the MOO
accounting problem posed by ``Aleph-null.'' [8]
</P>
<P>
The system recognizes one particular user ID (that of the ``super-user'') as
exempt from the usual constraints on file access; thus (for example),
programs may be written to dump and reload the file
system without
unwanted interference from the protection
system.
</P>
<H4>3.6 I/O calls
</H4>
<P>
The system calls to do I/O are designed to eliminate
the differences between the various devices and styles of
access.
There is no distinction between ``random''
and ``sequential'' I/O, nor is any logical record size imposed
by the system.
The size of an ordinary file is determined
by the number of bytes written on it;
no predetermination of the size of a file is necessary
or possible.
</P>
<P>
To illustrate the essentials of I/O,
some of the basic calls are
summarized below
in an anonymous language that will
indicate the required parameters without getting into the
underlying
complexities.
Each call to the system may potentially result in an error
return, which for simplicity is not represented
in the calling sequence.
</P>
<P>
To read or write a file assumed to exist already, it must
be opened by the following call:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
filep = open(name, flag)
</PRE></TT></DL>
where
<I>name</I>
indicates the name of the file.
An arbitrary path name may be given.
The
<I>flag</I>
argument indicates whether the file is to be read, written,
or ``updated,'' that is, read and written simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
The returned value
<I>filep</I>
is called a
<B>file descriptor</B>.
It is a small integer used to identify the file
in subsequent calls to read, write,
or otherwise manipulate the file.
</P>
<P>
To create a new file or completely rewrite an old one,
there is a
<I>create</I>
system call that
creates the given file if it does not exist,
or truncates it to zero length
if it does exist;
<I>create</I>
also opens the new file for writing
and, like
<I>open</I>,
returns a file descriptor.
</P>
<P>
The file system maintains no locks visible to the user, nor is there any
restriction on the number of users who may have a file
open for reading or writing.
Although it is possible for the contents of a file
to become scrambled when two users write on it simultaneously,
in practice difficulties do not arise.
We take the view that locks are neither
necessary nor sufficient, in our environment,
to prevent interference between users of the same file.
They are unnecessary because we are not
faced with large, single-file data bases
maintained by independent processes.
They are insufficient because
locks in the ordinary sense, whereby
one user is prevented from writing on a file that another
user is reading,
cannot prevent confusion
when, for example, both users are editing
a file with an editor that makes
a copy of the file being edited.
</P>
<P>
There are, however,
sufficient internal interlocks to maintain
the logical consistency of the file system
when two users engage simultaneously in
activities such as writing on
the same file,
creating files in the same directory,
or deleting each other's open files.
</P>
<P>
Except as indicated below, reading and writing
are sequential.
This means that if a particular
byte in the file was the last byte written (or read),
the next I/O call implicitly refers to the
immediately following byte.
For each open file there is a pointer, maintained
inside the system,
that indicates the next byte to be read
or written.
If
<B>n</B>
bytes are read or written, the pointer advances
by
<B>n</B>
bytes.
</P>
<P>
Once a file is open, the following calls
may be used:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
n = read(filep, buffer, count)
n = write(filep, buffer, count)
</PRE></TT></DL>
Up to
<I>count</I>
bytes are transmitted between the file specified
by
<I>filep</I>
and the byte array
specified by
<I>buffer</I>.
The returned value
<I>n</I>
is the number of bytes actually transmitted.
In the
<I>write</I>
case,
<I>n</I>
is the same as
<I>count</I>
except under exceptional conditions, such as I/O errors or
end of physical medium on special files;
in a
<I>read</I>,
however,
<I>n</I>
may without error be less than
<I>count</I>.
If the read pointer is so near the end of the
file that reading
<I>count</I>
characters
would cause reading beyond the end, only sufficient
bytes are transmitted to reach the end of the
file;
also, typewriter-like terminals
never return more than one line of input.
When a
<I>read</I>
call returns with
<I>n</I>
equal
to zero, the end of the file has been reached.
For disk files this occurs when the read pointer
becomes equal to the current
size of the file.
It is possible to generate an end-of-file
from a terminal by use of an escape
sequence that depends on the device used.
</P>
<P>
Bytes written affect only those parts of a file implied by
the position of the write pointer and the
count; no other part of the file
is changed.
If the last byte lies beyond the end of the file, the
file is made to grow as needed.
</P>
<P>
To do random (direct-access) I/O
it is only necessary to move the read or write pointer
to the appropriate location in the file.
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
location = lseek(filep, offset, base)
</PRE></TT></DL>
The pointer
associated with
<I>filep</I>
is moved to a position
<I>offset</I>
bytes from the beginning of the file, from the current position
of the pointer, or from the end of the file,
depending on
<I>base.</I>
<I>offset</I>
may be negative.
For some devices (e.g., paper
tape and
terminals) seek calls are
ignored.
The actual offset from the beginning of the file
to which the pointer was moved is returned
in
<I>location</I>.
</P>
<P>
There are several additional system entries
having to do with I/O and with the file
system that will not be discussed.
For example:
close a file,
get the status of a file,
change the protection mode or the owner
of a file,
create a directory,
make a link to an existing file,
delete a file.
</P>
<H4>IV. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FILE SYSTEM
</H4>
<P>
As mentioned in Section 3.2 above, a directory entry contains
only a name for the associated file and a pointer to the
file itself.
This pointer is an integer called the
<B>i-number</B>
(for index number)
of the file.
When the file is accessed,
its i-number is used as an index into
a system table (the
<B>i-list</B>)
stored in a known
part of the device on which
the directory resides.
The entry found thereby (the file's
<B>i-node</B>)
contains
the description of the file:
</P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>i<DD>
the user and group-ID of its owner
<DT>ii<DD>
its protection bits
<DT>iii<DD>
the physical disk or tape addresses for the file contents
<DT>iv<DD>
its size
<DT>v<DD>
time of creation, last use, and last modification
<DT>vi<DD>
the number of links to the file, that is, the number of times it appears in a directory
<DT>vii<DD>
a code indicating whether the file is a directory, an ordinary file, or a special file.
</dl>
<br>&#32;<br>
The purpose of an
<I>open</I>
or
<I>create</I>
system call is to turn the path name given by the user
into an i-number
by searching the explicitly or implicitly named directories.
Once a file is open,
its device, i-number, and read/write pointer are stored in a system table
indexed by the file descriptor returned by the
<I>open</I>
or
<I>create</I>.
Thus, during a subsequent
call to read or write the
file,
the descriptor
may be easily related to the information necessary to access the file.
<P>
When a new file is created,
an i-node is allocated for it and a directory entry is made
that contains the name of the file and the i-node
number.
Making a link to an existing file involves
creating a directory entry with the new name,
copying the i-number from the original file entry,
and incrementing the link-count field of the i-node.
Removing (deleting) a file is done by
decrementing the
link-count of the i-node specified by its directory entry
and erasing the directory entry.
If the link-count drops to 0,
any disk blocks in the file
are freed and the i-node is de-allocated.
</P>
<P>
The space on all disks that
contain a file system is divided into a number of
512-byte
blocks logically addressed from 0 up to a limit that
depends on the device.
There is space in the i-node of each file for 13 device addresses.
For nonspecial files,
the first 10 device addresses point at the first
10 blocks of the file.
If the file is larger than 10 blocks,
the 11 device address points to an
indirect block containing up to 128 addresses
of additional blocks in the file.
Still larger files use the twelfth device address
of the i-node to point to
a double-indirect block naming
128 indirect blocks,
each
pointing to 128 blocks of the file.
If required,
the thirteenth device address is
a triple-indirect block.
Thus files may conceptually grow to
[(10+128+128^2+128^3)*512] bytes.
Once opened,
bytes numbered below 5120 can be read with a single
disk access;
bytes in the range 5120 to 70,656
require two accesses;
bytes in the range 70,656
to 8,459,264
require three accesses;
bytes from there to the
largest file
(1,082,201,088)
require four accesses.
In practice,
a device cache mechanism
(see below)
proves effective in eliminating
most of the indirect fetches.
</P>
<P>
The foregoing discussion applies to ordinary files.
When an I/O request is made to a file whose i-node indicates that it
is special,
the last 12 device address words are immaterial,
and the first specifies
an internal
<B>device name</B>,
which is interpreted as a pair of numbers
representing,
respectively, a device type
and subdevice number.
The device type indicates which
system routine will deal with I/O on that device;
the subdevice number selects, for example, a disk drive
attached to a particular controller or one of several
similar terminal interfaces.
</P>
<P>
In this environment, the implementation of the
<I>mount</I>
system call (Section 3.4) is quite straightforward.
<I>mount</I>
maintains a system table whose
argument is the i-number and device name of the
ordinary file specified
during the
<I>mount</I>,
and whose corresponding value is the
device name of the indicated special file.
This table is searched for each i-number/device pair
that turns up while a path name is being scanned
during an
<I>open</I>
or
<I>create</I>;
if a match is found,
the i-number is replaced by the i-number of the root
directory
and the device name is replaced by the table value.
</P>
<P>
To the user, both reading and writing of files appear to
be synchronous and unbuffered.
That is, immediately after
return from a
<I>read</I>
call the data are available; conversely,
after a
<I>write</I>
the user's workspace may be reused.
In fact, the system maintains a rather complicated
buffering mechanism that reduces greatly the number
of I/O operations required to access a file.
Suppose a
<I>write</I>
call is made specifying transmission
of a single byte.
The system
will search its buffers to see
whether the affected disk block currently resides in main memory;
if not, it will be read in from the device.
Then the affected byte is replaced in the buffer and an
entry is made in a list of blocks to be written.
The return from the
<I>write</I>
call may then take place,
although the actual I/O may not be completed until a later time.
Conversely, if a single byte is read, the system determines
whether the secondary storage block in which the byte is located is already
in one of the system's buffers; if so, the byte can be returned immediately.
If not, the block is read into a buffer and the byte picked out.
</P>
<P>
The system recognizes when
a program has
made accesses to
sequential blocks of a file,
and asynchronously
pre-reads the next block.
This significantly reduces
the running time of most programs
while adding little to
system overhead.
</P>
<P>
A program that reads or writes files in units of 512 bytes
has an advantage over a program that reads or writes
a single byte at a time, but the gain is not immense;
it comes mainly from the avoidance of system overhead.
If a program is used rarely or does
no great volume of I/O, it may quite reasonably
read and write in units as small as it wishes.
</P>
<P>
The notion of the i-list is an unusual feature
of
Unix.
In practice, this method of organizing the file system
has proved quite reliable and easy to deal with.
To the system itself, one of its strengths is
the fact that each file has a short, unambiguous name
related in a simple way to the protection, addressing,
and other information needed to access the file.
It also permits a quite simple and rapid
algorithm for checking the consistency of a file system,
for example, verification
that the portions of each device containing useful information
and those free to be allocated are disjoint and together
exhaust the space on the device.
This algorithm is independent
of the directory hierarchy, because it need only scan
the linearly organized i-list.
At the same time the notion of the i-list induces certain
peculiarities not found in other file system organizations.
For example, there is the question of who is to be charged
for the space a file occupies,
because all directory entries for a file have equal status.
Charging the owner of a file is unfair in general,
for one user may create a file, another may link to
it, and the first user may delete the file.
The first user is still the owner of the
file, but it should be charged
to the second user.
The simplest reasonably fair algorithm
seems to be to spread the charges
equally among users who have links to a file.
Many installations
avoid the
issue by not charging any fees at all.
</P>
<H4>V. PROCESSES AND IMAGES
</H4>
<P>
An
<B>image</B>
is a computer execution environment.
It includes a memory image,
general register values,
status of open files,
current directory and the like.
An image is the current state of a pseudo-computer.
</P>
<P>
A
<B>process</B>
is the execution of an image.
While the processor is executing on behalf of a process,
the image must reside in main memory;
during the execution of other processes it remains in main memory
unless the appearance of an active, higher-priority
process
forces it to be swapped out to the disk.
</P>
<P>
The user-memory part of an image is divided into three logical segments.
The program text segment begins at location 0 in the virtual address space.
During execution, this segment is write-protected
and a single copy of it is shared among
all processes executing the same program.
At the first hardware protection byte boundary above the program text segment in the
virtual address space begins a non-shared, writable data segment,
the size of which may be extended by a system call.
Starting at the highest
address in the virtual address space is a stack segment,
which automatically grows downward
as the stack pointer fluctuates.
</P>
<H4>5.1 Processes
</H4>
<P>
Except while
the system
is bootstrapping itself into operation, a new
process can come into existence only
by use of the
<I>fork</I>
system call:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
processid = fork()
</PRE></TT></DL>
When
<I>fork</I>
is executed, the process
splits into two independently executing processes.
The two processes have independent
copies of the original memory image,
and share all open files.
The new processes differ only in that one is considered
the parent process:
in the parent,
the returned
<I>processid</I>
actually identifies the child process
and is never 0,
while in the child,
the returned value is always 0.
</P>
<P>
Because the values returned by
<I>fork</I>
in the parent and child process are distinguishable,
each process may determine whether
it is the parent or child.
</P>
<H4>5.2 Pipes
</H4>
<P>
Processes may communicate
with related processes using the same system
<I>read</I>
and
<I>write</I>
calls that are used for file-system I/O.
The call:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
filep = pipe()
</PRE></TT></DL>
returns a file descriptor
<I>filep</I>
and
creates an inter-process channel called a
<B>pipe</B>.
This channel, like other open files, is passed from parent to child process in
the image by the
<I>fork</I>
call.
A
<I>read</I>
using a pipe file descriptor
waits until another process writes using the
file descriptor for the same pipe.
At this point, data are passed between the images of the
two processes.
Neither process need know that a pipe,
rather than an ordinary file,
is involved.
</P>
<P>
Although
inter-process communication
via pipes is a quite valuable tool
(see Section 6.2),
it is not a completely general
mechanism,
because the pipe must be set up by a common ancestor
of the processes involved.
</P>
<H4>5.3 Execution of programs
</H4>
<P>
Another major system primitive
is invoked by
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
execute(file, arg1, arg2, ... , argn)
</PRE></TT></DL>
which requests the system to read in and execute the program
named by
<I>file</I>,
passing it string arguments
<I>arg1</I>,
<I>arg2</I>,
<I>...</I>,
<I>argn</I>.
All the code and data in the process invoking
<I>execute</I>
is replaced from the
<I>file</I>,
but
open files, current directory, and
inter-process relationships are unaltered.
Only if the call fails, for example
because
<I>file</I>
could not be found or because
its execute-permission bit was not set, does a return
take place from the
<I>execute</I>
primitive;
it resembles a ``jump'' machine instruction
rather than a subroutine call.
</P>
<H4>5.4 Process synchronization
</H4>
<P>
Another process control system call:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
processid = wait(status)
</PRE></TT></DL>
causes its caller to suspend
execution until one of its children has completed execution.
Then
<I>wait</I>
returns the
<I>processid</I>
of the terminated process.
An error return is taken if the calling process has no
descendants.
Certain status from the child process
is also available.
</P>
<H4>5.5 Termination
</H4>
<P>
Lastly:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
exit(status)
</PRE></TT></DL>
terminates a process,
destroys its image,
closes its open files,
and generally obliterates it.
The parent is notified through
the
<I>wait</I>
primitive,
and
<I>status</I>
is made available
to it.
Processes may also terminate as a result of
various illegal actions or user-generated signals
(Section VII below).
</P>
<H4>VI. THE SHELL
</H4>
<P>
For most users,
communication with
the system
is carried on with the
aid of a program called the shell.
The shell is a
command-line interpreter: it reads lines typed by the user and
interprets them as requests to execute
other programs.
(The shell is described fully elsewhere [9],
so this section will discuss only the theory of its operation.)
In simplest form, a command line consists of the command
name followed by arguments to the command, all separated
by spaces:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
command arg1 arg2 ... argn
</PRE></TT></DL>
The shell splits up the command name and the arguments into
separate strings.
Then a file with name
<I>command</I>
is sought;
<I>command</I>
may be a path name including the ``/'' character to
specify any file in the system.
If
<I>command</I>
is found, it is brought into
memory and executed.
The arguments
collected by the shell are accessible
to the command.
When the command is finished, the shell
resumes its own execution, and indicates its readiness
to accept another command by typing a prompt character.
</P>
<P>
If file
<I>command</I>
cannot be found,
the shell generally prefixes a string 
such as
<I>/bin/</I>
to
<I>command</I>
and
attempts again to find the file.
Directory
<I>/bin</I>
contains commands
intended to be generally used.
(The sequence of directories to be searched
may be changed by user request.)
</P>
<H4>6.1 Standard I/O
</H4>
<P>
The discussion of I/O in Section III above seems to imply that
every file used by a program must be opened or created by the program in
order to get a file descriptor for the file.
Programs executed by the shell, however, start off with
three open files with file descriptors
0, 1, and 2.
As such a program begins execution, file 1 is open for writing,
and is best understood as the standard output file.
Except under circumstances indicated below, this file
is the user's terminal.
Thus programs that wish to write informative
information ordinarily use file descriptor 1.
Conversely, file 0 starts off open for reading, and programs that
wish to read messages typed by the user
read this file.
</P>
<P>
The shell is able to change the standard assignments of
these file descriptors from the
user's terminal printer and keyboard.
If one of the
arguments to a command is prefixed by ``&#62;'', file descriptor
1 will, for the duration of the command, refer to the
file named after the ``&#62;''.
For example:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
ls
</PRE></TT></DL>
ordinarily lists, on the typewriter, the names of the files in the current
directory.
The command:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
ls &#62;there
</PRE></TT></DL>
creates a file called
<I>there</I>
and places the listing there.
Thus the argument
<I>>there</I>
means
``place output on
<I>there</I>.''
On the other hand:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
ed
</PRE></TT></DL>
ordinarily enters the editor, which takes requests from the
user via his keyboard.
The command
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
ed &#60;script
</PRE></TT></DL>
interprets
<I>script</I>
as a file of editor commands;
thus
``&#60;script''
means ``take input from
<I>script.''</I>
</P>
<P>
Although the file name following ``&#60;'' or ``&#62;'' appears
to be an argument to the command, in fact it is interpreted
completely by the shell and is not passed to the
command at all.
Thus no special coding to handle I/O redirection is needed within each
command; the command need merely use the standard file
descriptors 0 and 1 where appropriate.
</P>
<P>
File descriptor 2 is, like file 1,
ordinarily associated with the terminal output stream.
When an output-diversion request with ``&#62;'' is specified,
file 2 remains attached to the terminal, so that commands
may produce diagnostic messages that
do not silently end up in the output file.
</P>
<H4>6.2 Filters
</H4>
<P>
An extension of the standard I/O notion is used
to direct output from one command to
the input of another.
A sequence of commands separated by
vertical bars causes the shell to
execute all the commands simultaneously and to arrange
that the standard output of each command
be delivered to the standard input of
the next command in the sequence.
Thus in the command line:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
ls | pr -2 | opr
</PRE></TT></DL>
<I>ls</I>
lists the names of the files in the current directory;
its output is passed to
<I>pr</I>,
which
paginates its input with dated headings.
(The argument ``-2'' requests
double-column output.)
Likewise, the output from
<I>pr</I>
is input to
<I>opr</I>;
this command spools its input onto a file for off-line
printing.
</P>
<P>
This procedure could have been carried out
more clumsily by:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
ls &#62;temp1
pr -2 &#60;temp1 &#62;temp2
opr &#60;temp2
</PRE></TT></DL>
followed by removal of the temporary files.
In the absence of the ability
to redirect output and input,
a still clumsier method would have been to
require the
<I>ls</I>
command
to accept user requests to paginate its output,
to print in multi-column format, and to arrange
that its output be delivered off-line.
Actually it would be surprising, and in fact
unwise for efficiency reasons,
to expect authors of
commands such as
<I>ls</I>
to provide such a wide variety of output options.
</P>
<P>
A program
such as
<I>pr</I>
which copies its standard input to its standard output
(with processing)
is called a
<B>filter</B>.
Some filters that we have found useful
perform
character transliteration,
selection of lines according to a pattern,
sorting of the input,
and encryption and decryption.
</P>
<H4>6.3 Command separators; multitasking
</H4>
<P>
Another feature provided by the shell is relatively straightforward.
Commands need not be on different lines; instead they may be separated
by semicolons:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
ls; ed
</PRE></TT></DL>
will first list the contents of the current directory, then enter
the editor.
</P>
<P>
A related feature is more interesting.
If a command is followed
by ``<I>&amp;</I>,'' the shell will not wait for the command to finish before
prompting again; instead, it is ready immediately
to accept a new command.
For example:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
as source &#62;output &amp;
</PRE></TT></DL>
causes
<I>source</I>
to be assembled, with diagnostic
output going to
<I>output</I>;
no matter how long the
assembly takes, the shell returns immediately.
When the shell does not wait for
the completion of a command,
the identification number of the
process running that command is printed.
This identification may be used to
wait for the completion of the command or to
terminate it.
The ``<I>&amp;</I>'' may be used
several times in a line:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
as source &#62;output &amp; ls &#62;files &amp;
</PRE></TT></DL>
does both the assembly and the listing in the background.
In these examples, an output file
other than the terminal was provided; if this had not been
done, the outputs of the various commands would have been
intermingled.
</P>
<P>
The shell also allows parentheses in the above operations.
For example:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
(date; ls) &#62;x &amp;
</PRE></TT></DL>
writes the current date and time followed by
a list of the current directory onto the file
<I>x</I>.
The shell also returns immediately for another request.
</P>
<H4>6.4 The shell as a command; command files
</H4>
<P>
The shell is itself a command, and may be called recursively.
Suppose file
<I>tryout</I>
contains the lines:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
as source
mv a.out testprog
testprog
</PRE></TT></DL>
The
<I>mv</I>
command causes the file
<I>a.out</I>
to be renamed
<I>testprog.</I>
<I>a.out</I>
is the (binary) output of the assembler, ready to be executed.
Thus if the three lines above were typed on the keyboard,
<I>source</I>
would be assembled, the resulting program renamed
<I>testprog</I>,
and
<I>testprog</I>
executed.
When the lines are in
<I>tryout</I>,
the command:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
sh &#60;tryout
</PRE></TT></DL>
would cause the shell
<I>sh</I>
to execute the commands
sequentially.
</P>
<P>
The shell has further capabilities, including the
ability to substitute parameters
and
to construct argument lists from a specified
subset of the file names in a directory.
It also provides general conditional and looping constructions.
</P>
<H4>6.5 Implementation of the shell
</H4>
<P>
The outline of the operation of the shell can now be understood.
Most of the time, the shell
is waiting for the user to type a command.
When the
newline character ending the line
is typed, the shell's
<I>read</I>
call returns.
The shell analyzes the command line, putting the
arguments in a form appropriate for
<I>execute</I>.
Then
<I>fork</I>
is called.
The child process, whose code
of course is still that of the shell, attempts
to perform an
<I>execute</I>
with the appropriate arguments.
If successful, this will bring in and start execution of the program whose name
was given.
Meanwhile, the other process resulting from the
<I>fork</I>,
which is the
parent process,
<I>wait</I>s
for the child process to die.
When this happens, the shell knows the command is finished, so
it types its prompt and reads the keyboard to obtain another
command.
</P>
<P>
Given this framework, the implementation of background processes
is trivial; whenever a command line contains ``<I>&amp;</I>,''
the shell merely refrains from waiting for the process
that it created
to execute the command.
</P>
<P>
Happily, all of this mechanism meshes very nicely with
the notion of standard input and output files.
When a process is created by the
<I>fork</I>
primitive, it
inherits not only the memory image of its parent
but also all the files currently open in its parent,
including those with file descriptors 0, 1, and 2.
The shell, of course, uses these files to read command
lines and to write its prompts and diagnostics, and in the ordinary case
its children&#173;the command programs&#173;inherit them automatically.
When an argument with ``&#60;'' or ``&#62;'' is given, however, the
offspring process, just before it performs
<I>execute,</I>
makes the standard I/O
file descriptor (0 or 1, respectively) refer to the named file.
This is easy
because, by agreement,
the smallest unused file descriptor is assigned
when a new file is
<I>open</I>ed
(or
<I>create</I>d);
it is only necessary to close file 0 (or 1)
and open the named file.
Because the process in which the command program runs simply terminates
when it is through, the association between a file
specified after ``&#60;'' or ``&#62;'' and file descriptor 0 or 1 is ended
automatically when the process dies.
Therefore
the shell need not know the actual names of the files
that are its own standard input and output, because it need
never reopen them.
</P>
<P>
Filters are straightforward extensions
of standard I/O redirection with pipes used
instead of files.
</P>
<P>
In ordinary circumstances, the main loop of the shell never
terminates.
(The main loop includes the
branch of the return from
<I>fork</I>
belonging to the
parent process; that is, the branch that does a
<I>wait</I>,
then
reads another command line.)
The one thing that causes the shell to terminate is
discovering an end-of-file condition on its input file.
Thus, when the shell is executed as a command with
a given input file, as in:
<DL><DT><DD><TT><PRE>
sh &#60;comfile
</PRE></TT></DL>
the commands in
<I>comfile</I>
will be executed until
the end of
<I>comfile</I>
is reached; then the instance of the shell
invoked by
<I>sh</I>
will terminate.
Because this shell process
is the child of another instance of the shell, the
<I>wait</I>
executed in the latter will return, and another
command may then be processed.
</P>
<H4>6.6 Initialization
</H4>
<P>
The instances of the shell to which users type
commands are themselves children of another process.
The last step in the initialization of
the system
is the creation of
a single process and the invocation (via
<I>execute</I>)
of a program called
<I>init</I>.
The role of
<I>init</I>
is to create one process
for each terminal channel.
The various subinstances of
<I>init</I>
open the appropriate terminals
for input and output
on files 0, 1, and 2,
waiting, if necessary, for carrier to be established on dial-up lines.
Then a message is typed out requesting that the user log in.
When the user types a name or other identification,
the appropriate instance of
<I>init</I>
wakes up, receives the log-in
line, and reads a password file.
If the user's name is found, and if
he is able to supply the correct password,
<I>init</I>
changes to the user's default current directory, sets
the process's user ID to that of the person logging in, and performs
an
<I>execute</I>
of the shell.
At this point, the shell is ready to receive commands
and the logging-in protocol is complete.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the mainstream path of
<I>init</I>
(the parent of all
the subinstances of itself that will later become shells)
does a
<I>wait</I>.
If one of the child processes terminates, either
because a shell found an end of file or because a user
typed an incorrect name or password, this path of
<I>init</I>
simply recreates the defunct process, which in turn reopens the appropriate
input and output files and types another log-in message.
Thus a user may log out simply by typing the end-of-file
sequence to the shell.
</P>
<H4>6.7 Other programs as shell
</H4>
<P>
The shell as described above is designed to allow users
full access to the facilities of the system, because it will
invoke the execution of any program
with appropriate protection mode.
Sometimes, however, a different interface to the system
is desirable, and this feature is easily arranged for.
</P>
<P>
Recall that after a user has successfully logged in by supplying
a name and password,
<I>init</I>
ordinarily invokes the shell
to interpret command lines.
The user's entry
in the password file may contain the name
of a program to be invoked after log-in instead of the shell.
This program is free to interpret the user's messages
in any way it wishes.
</P>
<P>
For example, the password file entries
for users of a secretarial editing system
might
specify that the
editor
<I>ed</I>
is to be used instead of the shell.
Thus when users of the editing system log in, they are inside the editor and
can begin work immediately; also, they can be prevented from
invoking
programs not intended for their use.
In practice, it has proved desirable to allow a temporary
escape from the editor
to execute the formatting program and other utilities.
</P>
<P>
Several of the games (e.g., chess, blackjack, 3D tic-tac-toe)
available on
the system
illustrate
a much more severely restricted environment.
For each of these, an entry exists
in the password file specifying that the appropriate game-playing
program is to be invoked instead of the shell.
People who log in as a player
of one of these games find themselves limited to the
game and unable to investigate the (presumably more interesting)
offerings of
the
Unix
system
as a whole.
</P>
<H4>VII. TRAPS
</H4>
<P>
The PDP-11 hardware detects a number of program faults,
such as references to non-existent memory, unimplemented instructions,
and odd addresses used where an even address is required.
Such faults cause the processor to trap to a system routine.
Unless other arrangements have been made,
an illegal action causes the system
to terminate the process and to write its
image
on file
<I>core</I>
in the current directory.
A debugger can be used to determine
the state of the program at the time of the fault.
</P>
<P>
Programs that are looping, that produce unwanted output, or about which
the user has second thoughts may be halted by the use of the
<I>interrupt</I>
signal, which is generated by typing the ``delete''
character.
Unless special action has been taken, this
signal simply causes the program to cease execution
without producing a
<I>core</I>
file.
There is also a
<I>quit</I>
signal
used to force an image file to be produced.
Thus programs that loop unexpectedly may be
halted and the remains inspected without prearrangement.
</P>
<P>
The hardware-generated faults
and the interrupt and quit signals
can, by request, be either ignored or caught by a process.
For example,
the shell ignores quits to prevent
a quit from logging the user out.
The editor catches interrupts and returns
to its command level.
This is useful for stopping long printouts
without losing work in progress (the editor
manipulates a copy of the file it is editing).
In systems without floating-point hardware,
unimplemented instructions are caught
and floating-point instructions are
interpreted.
</P>
<H4>VIII. PERSPECTIVE
</H4>
<P>
Perhaps paradoxically,
the success of
the
Unix
system
is largely due to the fact that it was not
designed to meet any
predefined objectives.
The first version was written when one of us
(Thompson),
dissatisfied with the available computer facilities,
discovered a little-used PDP-7
and set out to create a more
hospitable environment.
This (essentially personal) effort was
sufficiently successful
to gain the interest of the other author
and several colleagues,
and later to justify the acquisition
of the PDP-11/20, specifically to support
a text editing and formatting system.
When in turn the 11/20 was outgrown,
the system
had proved useful enough to persuade management to
invest in the PDP-11/45,
and later in the
PDP-11/70 and Interdata 8/32 machines,
upon which it developed to its present form.
Our goals throughout the effort,
when articulated at all, have always been to build
a comfortable relationship with the machine
and to explore ideas and inventions in operating systems
and other software.
We have not been faced with the need to satisfy someone
else's requirements,
and for this freedom we are grateful.
</P>
<P>
Three considerations that influenced the design of
Unix
are visible in retrospect.
</P>
<P>
First:
because we are programmers,
we naturally designed the system to make it easy to
write, test, and run programs.
The most important expression of our desire for
programming convenience
was that the system
was arranged for interactive use,
even though the original version only
supported one user.
We believe that a properly designed
interactive system is much more
productive
and satisfying to use than a ``batch'' system.
Moreover, such a system is rather easily
adaptable to noninteractive use, while the converse is not true.
</P>
<P>
Second:
there have always been fairly severe size constraints
on the system and its software.
Given the partially antagonistic desires for reasonable efficiency and
expressive power,
the size constraint has encouraged
not only economy, but also a certain elegance of design.
This may be a thinly disguised version of the ``salvation
through suffering'' philosophy,
but in our case it worked.
</P>
<P>
Third: nearly from the start, the system was able to, and did, maintain itself.
This fact is more important than it might seem.
If designers of a system are forced to use that system,
they quickly become aware of its functional and superficial deficiencies
and are strongly motivated to correct them before it is too late.
Because all source programs were always available
and easily modified on-line,
we were willing to revise and rewrite the system and its software
when new ideas were invented, discovered,
or suggested by others.
</P>
<P>
The aspects of
Unix
discussed in this paper exhibit clearly
at least the first two of these
design considerations.
The interface to the file
system, for example, is extremely convenient from
a programming standpoint.
The lowest possible interface level is designed
to eliminate distinctions
between
the various devices and files and between
direct and sequential access.
No large ``access method'' routines
are required
to insulate the programmer from the
system calls;
in fact, all user programs either call the system
directly or
use a small library program, less than a page long,
that buffers a number of characters
and reads or writes them all at once.
</P>
<P>
Another important aspect of programming
convenience is that there are no ``control blocks''
with a complicated structure partially maintained by
and depended on by the file system or other system calls.
Generally speaking, the contents of a program's address space
are the property of the program, and we have tried to
avoid placing restrictions
on the data structures within that address space.
</P>
<P>
Given the requirement
that all programs should be usable with any file or
device as input or output,
it is also desirable
to push device-dependent considerations
into the operating system itself.
The only alternatives seem to be to load,
with all programs,
routines for dealing with each device,
which is expensive in space,
or to depend on some means of dynamically linking to
the routine appropriate to each device when it is actually
needed,
which is expensive either in overhead or in hardware.
</P>
<P>
Likewise,
the process-control scheme and the command interface
have proved both convenient and efficient.
Because the shell operates as an ordinary, swappable
user program,
it consumes no ``wired-down'' space in the system proper,
and it may be made as powerful as desired
at little cost.
In particular,
given the framework in which the shell executes
as a process that spawns other processes to
perform commands,
the notions of I/O redirection, background processes,
command files, and user-selectable system interfaces
all become essentially trivial to implement.
</P>
<H4>Influences
</H4>
<P>
The success of
Unix
lies
not so much in new inventions
but rather in the full exploitation of a carefully selected
set of fertile ideas,
and especially in showing that
they can be keys to the implementation of a small
yet powerful operating system.
</P>
<P>
The
<I>fork</I>
operation, essentially as we implemented it, was
present in the GENIE time-sharing system [10].
On a number of points we were influenced by Multics,
which suggested the particular form of the I/O system calls [11],
and both the name of the shell and its general functions.
The notion that the shell should create a process
for each command was also suggested to us by
the early design of Multics, although in that
system it was later dropped for efficiency reasons.
A similar scheme is used by TENEX [12].

<H4>IX. STATISTICS

<P>
The following numbers
are presented to suggest the scale of the Research
Unix
operation.
Those of our users
not involved in document preparation
tend to use the system for
program development, especially language work.
There are few important
``applications'' programs.

<P>
Overall, we have today:

<br>&#32;<br>
There is a ``background'' process that
runs at the lowest possible priority; it is used
to soak up any idle CPU time.
It has been used to produce a million-digit
approximation to the constant <I>e</I>,
and other semi-infinite problems.
Not counting this background work, we average daily:

<H4>X. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
</H4>
<P>
The contributors to
Unix
are, in the traditional but here especially apposite
phrase, too numerous to mention.
Certainly, collective salutes are due to our colleagues in the
Computing Science Research Center.
R. H. Canaday contributed much to the basic design of the
file system.
We are particularly appreciative
of the inventiveness,
thoughtful criticism,
and constant support of
R. Morris, M. D. McIlroy,
and J. F. Ossanna.
