<DL><DD><H4>ABSTRACT</H4>
Ken Thompson's work on chess and Unix are his best-known contributions,
but all this work was intertwined with other game and recreational
activities. This note describes some of the synergies.
</DL>


<p>
Ken Thompson's work on computer games is best known in the chess
world: in particular his Belle series of chess-playing machines, and
then for his endgame analyses.  However, his game-inspired work has
been intertwined, sometimes in surprising ways, with many of his
broader technical contribution to the computer world.

<p>
Throughout his career at the Labs, Ken devoted amazing energy to games
of various kinds.  Most significant for his future was Space Travel
(Ritchie, 2001), a
simple navigation entertainment that featured a space ship centered on
a graphics screen showing a solar system with a sun, planets, and
moons, in which the object was to land on a planet or moon.

<p>
This trivial game's interest is magnified only because it led Ken to
take over an already-aging Digital Equipment PDP-7 computer.  Once he
had established squatter's rights over the machine and had learned how
to generate programs for it, he wrote the first version of the Unix
system.  He had wanted to build his own operating system for some
time; free access to the PDP-7 provided a home for it.  Once Unix was
running, games and recreations appeared soon.

<p>
Some of the things Ken wrote on the PDP-7 by 1969 include

<UL>

<p>
<LI>Enumerating closed-knight's tours on various size chessboards;
   he prepared a notebook with the numbers.  His program would,
   if asked, show graphically the tries it was making--the current
   path being investigated, with the ends vibrating madly.

<p>
<LI>An investigation of a strategy for Moo
(Aleph-null, 1971; Grochow, 1972),
the game we learned about
   from Cambridge University.  It was also called Bulls and Cows: <I>dealer</I>
   picks a number of 4 different decimal digits, <I>player</I> guesses the
number, dealer
   tells player the number of <I>Bulls</I> (<I>Cows</I>),
correct digits in the right (wrong) place.
Ken's result was a large notebook
   with a complete strategy.  Its first page said "guess 1234".
   Depending on the number of bulls and cows, it sent you to
   other pages, with a new suggested guess--a complete game tree.
   It was not precisely optimal; it didn't evaluate probabilities
   as such, but instead min-maxed on the number
   of possible responses locally in the game tree.

<p>
<LI>A graphical-interface 3D tic-tac-toe
   program (4x4x4) run with the light pen.  Later,
   Ken had some interaction with Ron Graham and especially
   Oren Patashnik about strategy for the game, but didn't
   pursue this especially.
The game was later solved as a win for the first player
(Patashnik, 1980).

</UL>

<p>
Once we had moved to the PDP-11, and Unix was beginning to achieve
some visibility, Ken continued various game-related activities.  Some
were just simple text interactions, like a Blackjack opponent, or a
rewriting of the "Hunt-the-Wumpus" game.  Many of these were written
for his son Cory, then at just the age to play with them.  Some were
not games as such, but recreational demos: he wrote an interpreter for
the Snobol language, and illustrated it with a program that solved the
Instant Insanity puzzle.

<p>
Some of his programs were one-off solutions to various problems
garnered by Martin Gardner's Mathematical Games column in Scientific
American, like a search for strategies in the David Gale game of
Chomp.

<p>
Ken's computer chess interest began early--he wrote a chess-playing
program mentioned in Unix's first edition manual (1971).  This
earliest effort was purely in software, but fairly soon he began to
build hardware to help out: the various hardware-assisted Belle
programs.  The earliest hardware was almost purely a move-generator.

<p>
Later versions began to incorporate increasingly sophisticated board
evaluation and parts of the tree searching algorithm in the programmed
logic.  Still later, he began his long-term endgame database project.

Ken was and is amazingly productive, and became involved in many
things.  Often the diversions sparked by games created economically
productive research.  If the most obvious was the take-over of the
PDP-7, others are less visible; the same semi-automated wire-wrap
machine that Ken and Joe Condon assembled was used to construct not
only Belle, but also much other research hardware used in Bell Labs,
for example evaluation of Ising models in the physics of spin glasses.

<p>

In more recent years, Ken spent much time on the software-engineering
aspects of clever compression and decompression of digital music,
based on algorithms and research done by a nearby group in AT&amp;T and
now Lucent.  In the course of this visibly company-related work, he
also collected an enormous quantity of digitally-encoded music, mostly
for his own enjoyment.  No, none of it came from or made available to
Napster.

<p>
When the chess aspect of Ken's career became visible, and in
particular when Belle began doing well in computer chess tournaments,
our management must have worried a bit about whether we wanted
publicity about developing a champion chess-playing machine.  So far
as I know, these worries weren't expressed to Ken, even in the face of a 
<A href="leskmemo4.gif">hilarious fake memo</A>,
written on the real (albeit stolen) letterhead
of AT&amp;T's chairman.
<p>
<blockquote>
ICGA's caption is just "The fake memo", accompanied by their
footnote (based on DMR information):
<p>
<blockquote>
Some background: In 1978, AT&amp;T was rather closely regulated both
by the federal government and in each state by their regulatory
commissions.  In particular, there were rules about being a communications
company and not a computer (or for that matter fast-burger) company, the
fear being that regulated business with fixed rates would subsidise
entrepreneurial things.  The California regulatory group was one of
the particularly difficult ones.  Wilma Soss was a perennial gadfly
at shareholder meetings including AT&amp;T's, asking peculiar and
embarrassing questions out loud.

<p>
The `memo' was created by Mike Lesk (of uucp, lex, and other things)
on the board chairman's deButts' actual stationery.
Sam Morgan, CSRC Director at the time, was half-way through
the memo before he suspected a fake.

<p>

IBM, I've learned, went through the same managerial soul-searching
over the Deep Blue research project that culminated in the famous
Kasparov match.  Both AT&amp;T and IBM seem to have ended up winners (both
in publicity and technology) by backing their researchers'
unconventional tendencies.

<p>
Ken has always been a problem solver and a tool builder.  He is
equally excited by games, puzzles, and technology creation, and I
don't think he really distinguishes among them.
