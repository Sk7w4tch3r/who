Advice from Doug Mcilroy
</center>
</h4>

Attached by magnet to the wall of my office is a yellowed
sheet of paper, evidently the tenth page of an internal Bell Labs memo by
<A href="http://www.cs.bell-labs.com/who/doug/index.html">Doug McIlroy</A>.
Unfortunately, I don't have the rest of the note.
<p>
When this was written, in 1964, Bell Labs computing was for the most part done
on IBM 7090 or 7094 equipment, mostly in batch mode, using an IBM 1401 to
prepare tapes from card decks and print output, also transmitted by tape
between the mainframe and the 1401.  This kind of operation was typical of
the age.  Bell Labs was somewhat apart from the ordinary;
the operating system was locally developed (BESYS), and there was
a certain amount of advanced hardware attached.  Some of this was
in direct support of smooth batch operation, like gadgetry on the
tape drives to crossbar the drives with their channels, and
some was with display devices, like the PDP-7 computer used to control
a Graphics II display system--this was the machine commandeered a bit later
to build Unix on.
<p>
In the software area, besides BESYS itself, there was considerable
language work, notably BLODI (essentially, early dataflow architecture)
and Snobol (string processing).  McIlroy's particular specialty at that
stage was macro-processing, but he had and has broad interests.

<p>
1964 was also the time that the
<a href="http://www.multicians.org">Multics project</a>
was at the point of beginning.
Some of these thoughts either influenced the design of Multics
or encouraged Bell Labs to take part in it.  One in particular
was important to us.
<p>
Here is the page-on-the-wall, retyped.
A <A href="mdmpipe.pdf">PDF scan</A> (pretty big at 49K) scan of
the original lets you see that it was produced on a typewriter
(and also the damage over the years, and that the
duplicated "when" phrase is historically accurate).

Summary--what's most important.
</center>

<p>
To put my strongest concerns into a nutshell:
<p>
1. We should have some ways of connecting programs like
garden hose--screw in another segment when it becomes when
it becomes necessary to massage data in another way.
This is the way of IO also.
<p>
2. Our loader should be able to do link-loading
and controlled establishment.
<p>
3. Our library filing scheme should allow for rather general
indexing, responsibility, generations, data path
switching.
<p>
4. It should be possible to get private system components
(all routines are system components) for buggering around with.

What did Doug mean, and what came from the thoughts?
<p>
<ul>

<li>
Point 1 is the interesting one.  It provides the historical
background for Doug's encouragement
of the <A href="hist.html#pipes"> Unix pipe notation</A>.
The linked paper gives appropriate credit; in interviews, Doug
has been explicit in saying that he very nearly exercised
managerial control to get pipes installed.
</li>
<p>
<li>
Point 2 is a bit mysterious without further context.
It is possible to read it as advocating mechanisms (dynamic
linking) that were pioneered in Multics.
</li>
<p>
<li>
Point 3 is almost certainly the one that still bugs Doug.
All sorts of mechanisms and utilities are around and used
(source code control, registries, WWW search engines,
and on and on), but the problem of indexing and finding relevant
information is tougher today than ever before,
even on one's own hard disk, let alone the WWW.
</li>
<p>
<li>
One might argue that Point 4 is to some extent under
control, depending on what Doug was really getting at.
One thinks about the dynamic linking mechanism combined
with search paths in Multics (close to the time of the note)
and its offspring in more recent systems.
Possibly one could create a connection to the free software
movement, but this would be tenuous at best; I suspect that
he was thinking "how can I test this seemingly monolithic program
against the <I>sin</I> routine I've just written and want to test?".
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Point 1's garden hose connection analogy, though, is the one that ultimately
whacked us on the head to best effect.
