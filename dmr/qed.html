<center><H2>An incomplete history of the
<br>QED Text Editor
</H2>

<I>Dennis Ritchie<br>

<P>
</center>
The text editors <b>ed</b> and <b>vi</b>, still much-used on Unix
systems and elsewhere, have a long history, some bits of
which are recounted here.
<P>
The QED text editor was first written by Butler Lampson and
Peter Deutsch for the Berkeley time-sharing system on the
SDS 940; see their paper in C. ACM <b>10</b> #12 (December, 1967).
<P>
Ken Thompson used this QED at Berkeley before he came to Bell Labs,
and among the first things he did on arriving was to write
a new version for the MIT CTSS system.
Written in IBM 7090 assembly language, it
differed from the Berkeley version most notably in introducing
regular expressions for specifying strings to seek within the document
being edited,
and to specify a substring for which a substitution should be made.
Until that time, text editors could search for a literal string,
and substitute for one, but not specify more general strings.
<P>
Ken not only introduced a new idea, he found an inventive
implementation: on-the-fly compiling.
Ken's QED compiled machine code for each regular expression
that created a NDFA (non-deterministic finite automaton)
to do the search.
He published this in C. ACM <b>11</b> #6, and also
received a patent for the technique:
<a href="http://www.uspto.gov/patft/index.html">US Patent #3568156</a>.
(Who said you couldn't get a software patent until recently?)
<P>
While the Berkeley QED was character-oriented, the CTSS version
was line-oriented. Ken's CTSS qed adopted from the Berkeley one the notion
of multiple buffers to edit several files simultaneously
and to move and copy text among them, and also
the idea of executing a given buffer as editor
commands, thus providing programmability.  (TECO, which
grew into Emacs, was approximately contemporaneous
or just a bit later, and elaborated these ideas independently).
<P>
CTSS was used at Bell Labs as part of our participation in the
<a href="http://www.multicians.org/general.html">Multics</a>
project, and as Ken began to use Multics, he wrote yet another
version of QED for that system.  This one was in BCPL,
and instead of compiling to machine code, regular expressions
were represented as trees that were interpreted by the editor.
However, the basic technique of simulating an NDFA was
still used.
<P>
During the same period (ca. 1967), I arrived at Bell Labs, and fairly
soon thereafter the company began withdrawing from Multics.  Unix was
at first nonexistent and then embryonic, and the main computation
resource was GE-TSS, GE's time-sharing system for GECOS.
I liked QED, and so set out to write a version of it for
this system.  This, like Ken's CTSS QED, was written in
assembly language and compiled its regular expressions
to machine code.
<P>
This version was described in an internal technical memo,
which is obtainable either in a slightly cut-down
<a href="qedman.html">HTML browsable</a> format, or
reproduced as a scanned (and big: 1.1MB)
<a href="qedman.pdf">PDF image</a>.
<P>
I wrote some incomplete notes of this QED's
<a href="qeddoc.html">internal workings</a>.
This was intended to be a published paper, but was never
finished.
<p>
This QED was probably the most baroque and
complicated of all its manifestations,
particularly in pushing "regular expressions" well beyond
what Kleene thought they should do.
Other and later offspring of
QED and its predecessors kept
the central ideas, but were considerably simpler.
<p>
For a brief period in the 1970s, the GECOS QED served us
as a scripting language; it was in some ways analogous
to the Awk or Perl of today.  It was used for
such tasks as submitting batch jobs, formatting
files for the printer, collecting statistics on
a file.
A collection of macros to do various
useful tasks was put in a commonly available place.
<p>
By 1974, Jay Michlin
at Bell Labs wrote a version approximating this
rendition for the IBM TSO system, and it was
used at the Labs locations using IBM
hardware and software.  It seems that this version (or perhaps
another reimplementation) was released: I have the
first few pages of a document, courtesy of Joshua Ryan,
that were used as "TSO Short Course Notes" at University
of Missouri--Columbia.  These discuss BQED, "an editor
developed at Bell Labs.... BQED actually has fewer general-purpose
commands than EDIT.... many of these concisely-stated commands
cannot be performed by the other editors."  (Ryan's UMC notes
also talk about an apparently unrelated QED, for "Quick Edit").

<br>
<H4>Offspring</H4>
The "standard Unix editor" <b>ed</b> was first
written by Ken Thompson for the PDP-7.
It kept the basic text-line orientation, but radically
simplified the regular expressions to include only
the <b>*</b>operator: no alternation, no parentheses.
Where my QED embraced much of the context-free languages,
this version could not even express all regular languages.
It was not much of a loss.
<p>
Similarly, Ken's Unix <b>ed</b> ditched the notion
of multiple buffers and of execution of buffers.
Subsequent versions of <b>ed</b> for Unix (now
written in C) began to add back some of the complexity
(e.g. back-referencing in "regular" expressions, which
now didn't quite include all the regular languages
nor context-free languages, but did intrude a bit
on the context-sensitive languages.)
<p>
Subsequent developments along this line include
<b>vi</b>, done mostly by Bill Joy at UC Berkeley.
According to George Coulouris, <b>vi</b> was
based on (or at least inspired by) the
<A href="http://www.dcs.qmul.ac.uk/~george/history/">
<b>em</b> editor</A>
done at Queen Mary College in London.
The advance here was essentially to adapt the
command-set of <b>ed</b> to a screen-editor format;
instead of doing things on (possibly virtual)
paper on a typewriter, <b>vi</b> keeps a current
view of a piece of a document on the screen, while
commands are typed on the bottom line.
Keeping a constantly updated window on a part of the text being edited
is now, of course, completely standard and accepted.
The same program, under the name <b>ex</b>, works better on typewriter-like
terminals; aside from some fancier commands and better diagnostics,
it's essentially <b>ed</b>.
<P>
The current local state of the QED line of descent is exemplified
by <b>sam</b>, by
<a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cs/who/rob">Rob Pike</a>
(see his "The Text Editor sam,"
in Software -- Practice and Experience <b>17</b>
#11, Nov. 1987).  It's available for FTP in both
Unix and Windows versions; search
for "sam editor" on
<a href="http://netlib.bell-labs.com/netlib/search.html">netlib</a>.
<b>Sam</b> offers cut-and-paste, mouse-and-menu editing on its text windows
together with a command window, the language of which is drawn
from the QED line of descent.
<p>
The current implementation of regular expressions in
Bell Labs research software uses algorithms close to those
in Ken's CTSS and Multics versions, particularly the latter,
because they don't try to compile to machine code.
They have been elaborated somewhat in that they deal with
a very large character set (Unicode), but they keep both
the classical set of operators (<b>*</b>, <b>|</b>, concatenation,
grouping for parentheses) and the NDFA simulation.
We've done some fairly elaborate versions of <b>grep</b> that
construct DFAs dynamically on demand, use Boyer-Moore techniques
for fast searching of fixed strings, and so on.  In the end
simple and solid seems best.
Indeed, there have been many approximate reimplementations
of <i>ed</i>, including a basic and didactic one
by Kernighan and Plauger in <i>Software Tools</i> (1976),
and eventually the expectable
<A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/ed/ed.html">
GNU version</A>; there seems also to be
a "more user-friendly" rendition called
<A href="http://users.evitech.fi/~laurijh/">
bole</A>.
<p>
Going back to the 1970s, QED had other offspring.
Bob Daley wrote an editor
called <b>qedx</b> in PL/1 for the Multics project.
See, for example, Tom Van Vleck's encyclopedic
<a href="http://www.multicians.org/mgq.html">discussion</a>
of Multics things (this pointer being to things
beginning with Q).
The tart comments about the rebarbativeness of QED
as a scripting language are on the mark, though I don't
think that Emacs is all that much better.
An offspring of qedx,
<A href="http://www.multicians.org/mgt.html#ted">ted</A>,
was later done by Jim Falksen of Honeywell and
became a Multics product.
<p>
A traditional (and maybe the nicest)
version of QED was done at the
University of Toronto by Tom Duff, Rob Pike, Hugh Redelmeier,
and David Tilbrook; it supports multiple buffers,
execution of buffers, and regular expressions with
back-referencing.  A more recent Canadian version, also a traditional-style
descendant, is <a href="http://www.thinkage.ca/english/gcos/expl/fred/expl.html">Fred</a>,
from <a href="http://www.thinkage.ca">Thinkage Ltd</a>.  It, like
various earlier versions, is available for Honeywell GCOS systems
and is still used as a scripting language as well as a line-editor
for TTY-like communications interfaces.
