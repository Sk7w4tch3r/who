Unless you are as powerful as Disney, Coca-Cola, or the Olympic Committee, worldwide and
universal trademarks don't exist; the same name can often be used in trade for completely
different things.  Details depend on the country, the category of goods offered, and
of course the tenacity and wealth of the trademark holder.
I recall, evidently correctly, that Unix Pacific, the organization created
to distribute and support AT&amp;T (later USL) Unix systems
in the Asia/Pacific area had to <A href="http://japanlaw.info/lawletter/aug84/dca.htm">
step carefully around</A> trademark issues with Marantz in Japan.

<p>
UNIX&reg; was registered by Bell Laboratories as a
trademark for computer operating systems.
Today this mark
is owned by <A href="http://www.opengroup.org/tm-guidelines.htm">
Open Group</A>, who are happy to tell you about how they would
like it to be used.

I decided to gather whatever not-our-Unix items I could; here is the
current harvest.
Other sightings and scans gratefully accepted.
<p>

When you look up the four letters in the
search engines of the
<a href="http://www.uspto.gov">
US Patent and Trademark Office</A>,
you find many products that use the name in some way.
Many clearly refer to the OS, but others seem independent.  For example,
to clip one out, we find

Word Mark: UNIX DIAPERS BY PANNOLINI
 Translation: The english translation of PANNOLINI is "diapers".
 Owner Name: (REGISTRANT) Pannolini de Mexico, S.A. de C.V.
 Disclaimer: NO CLAIM IS MADE TO THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHT TO USE "DIAPERS" and
 "PANNOLINI" APART FROM THE MARK AS SHOWN
</pre>

<p>
Evidently, there are various products bearing the Unix name that are completely
unrelated to computer software, and their manufacturers seem to have invented the
same name independently.  Some, like the diapers, are recorded in the US;
the ones below are advertised, delivered, or photographed products from
around the world.

<p>
The Pannolini Unix diapers are not a mere will o' the wisp;
one correspondent supplied an image of the box, and the current owner of this
instance of the name responded to mail to their webmaster.  See below for the pic and
the tale.

<p><spacer type=vertical size=100>
Noel Hunt kindly supplied a scan
of the label on a Unix brand food container (resembling Tupperware in the US);
it is from Japan.
We previously had one of the actual containers, but it seems to have been lost.
Ours was much smaller than 630ml; instead it was sized to contain a single sushi.

<p>
Brett of BNL bought the 1.35l model in a Japanese super market
in Fort Lee, NJ (discount price USD4.59) and sent a scan, omitted
here.

A photo of the Unix fire extinguisher, apparently Spanish in
manufacture, was taken by
Christer Gustavsson on Gran Canaria.
Lars Brinkhoff reported this copy. Noel Hunt happened upon
<A href="http://www.swiss.ai.mit.edu/projects/mac/unix-extinguisher.jpg">
a different photo</A> of the same product.

<img src="unix3image.gif" alt="British Unix Bookshelving 1" align=left hspace=30>
<p><spacer type=vertical size=100>
There has been a Unix brand of modular book shelving from the UK.
Karri Kalpio sent a scan of this ad.
I am especially taken by its observation that
"Some people open all the windows; wise wives welcome spring
by moving the UNIX....
UNIX make moving not pain but almost pleasure, and are easily moved
from room to room, upstairs or down.... they're not expensive,
just hard to make."

<p>
I showed a prototype of this page to Brian Kernighan, and he forthwith
dug into his files and found an original paper version of a different ad for the same
product.  This page is getting too graphics-rich, so I won't display it separately.
It lacks the quotable phrases from the one displayed, but it is
<A href="bwkbookcase.jpg"> available</A> for viewing.
Kernighan's, as we shall see, dates from
at least 10 years after than this one.

<p>
The scan displayed here (which has been res-reduced)
seems certain to derive from one by Ian Utting at
University of Kent, Canterbury,
UK.  He has a scan of the same advert,
and indeed the original page from which it was made.  His original came
from <i>Housewife</i> magazine, p.127, April 1941, Vol 3 No 4,
published by Hulton Press, London.
Ian's <A href="http://www.cs.ukc.ac.uk/people/staff/iau">
page is here</A>; click on his ad to see an unreduced version.

<p>
Utting's sighting represents the earliest
reference I've seen, and it comes with a reliable date.

Lars Brinkhoff, Jorgen Grahn and others pointed out
<A href="http://www.carioca.it/english/prodotti/frameprod.htm">
Universal</A>, an Italian company manufacturing Unix pens,
pencils and other office supplies.
They have a full WWW page. An image (from Grahn) is illustrated.
Other representations of various products are visible at
<A href="http://lars.nocrew.org/unix_line_1.jpg"> Lars Brinkhoff's site</A>.
Inside the home page of
<A href="http://jumi.lut.fi">Ruut</A>,
the computer club at Lappeenranta University of Technology in
Lappeenranta, Finland,
appears a photo of
<A href="http://jumi.lut.fi/ruut/images/unixliima.jpg">Tomi Lapinlampi</A>
of the club, bearing Unix glue.
(The label says "general glue.")
You will need Finnish language skills for most of their pages.
<p>
Another photo of the same product was sent by
Tommi Hassinen, of the University of Kuopio, likewise
in Finland.
<p>
This Italian company seems to have strong marketing in Scandinavia.
I just received from Karri Huhtanen this note, accompanied by a photo:
<p>
<blockquote>

We (me, Sami Keski-Kasari and Heikki Vatiainen) were trying to compose a

would represent the things needed in Symbian mobile software programming 
like glue, gum, java, iron wire, duct tape and of course theory book.
<p>
Sami went to local cheap general store chain called HalpaHalli to get 
some of the things needed and found this UNIX-branded glue among other 
things shown also in picture:

Mark Horton, long at Bell Labs and now
with Avaya, kindly sent an unopened package of five UNIX 2001
ballpoint pens,
purchased in the US. It seems to be from the same company,
so they sell here as well.

<p>
Others keep seeing their products: e.g. Brad Knowles,
who commends the company's line of
<A href="http://www.shub-internet.org/brad/pictures/unix-line-memory.jpg">
highlighter</A> pens.
<p>
Rob Wolfram has just reported seeing Unix Line pens
in Suriname, on the northern coast of South America.
<p>
I have more than enough pictures of their products!

<p><spacer type=vertical size=100>
Exploring further the Finnish connection, though one which has no evident
relationship to other Unix products: Kimmo Ketolainen sent a scan
of an ad for a Unix Drying Rack, marketed in Finland.  The text
(which I cropped) promises
"Quick and easy to install ... All in all, Unix can support up
to 12kg of laundry ... Up to 12m of drying space."

<p><spacer type=vertical size=50>
Federico Ulivi of Milan sent a photo of another Italian product, whose marking
translates to "Nitro-based antifog thinner."  He collected the can
after it was used as a thinner during repainting of hand rails
in the office of a former employer.
Chimica CBR don't seem to be associated with Universal of the office
supplies.

Ralf took this photo on a visit to Morretes, Paran&aacute;, Brazil.
He says that the frame on which the bucket is resting is used
to store trash out of the reach of animals until it's picked up.

<br clear=left><p>
<img src="unixfung1.jpg" alt="Unix fungicide poster" align=left vspace=10>
<p>
Fazal Majid captured the large photo during a visit to
Caen, France around 1994; it depicts a poster on the wall of a flower
shop.  Just after he sent it to me, he alerted me to the then-current
home site of the product; the second
picture was captured from there.
He and I were both charmed by its phrase "There are those who take risks, and those
who take UNIX."

<p>
Since then, the company has changed hands, as was kindly pointed out
by Khalid Baheyeldin.  The product is still present on the
<A href="http://www.syngenta-agro.fr/product/fiche_technique.asp?id=1222">
Syngenta</A> web site, but accompanyied by less interesting advertising.  Still, if
you can handle PDF pages, you could check
<A href="http://www.syngenta-agro.fr/data/notice_produit/pdf_notice_unix.pdf">
one of the ads</A>.
<p>
When Majid sent the first image, I guessed (perhaps hoped) that
the anti-fungal properties of the product were intended for
the personal, perhaps intimate, use of the nouvelle g&eacute;n&eacute;ration.
It is in fact a product for fungal diseases of wheat and barley.

<p>
Christian Lefebvre recently sent another ad image for the same
product (not shown), but we both like the main text words:
"Unix en granul&eacute; dispersable, la formulation de l'avenir,"
or "Unix in dispersible pellets, the formulation for the future."

<p>
Andy Ward subsequently sent along an image of a UK ad for
(presumably) the same product.
It advises us that "UNIX&reg; [is] the essential partner for
eyespot or rynchosporium control in barley."
Well said.

<img src="iranant.jpg" alt="Unix TV antenna, Iran" align=left vspace=10>
<p>
Dick Snippe of the Netherlands took a photo of a box containing a
Unix TV antenna.  It was outside a shop on the main street of
Kerman, in eastern Iran.
If you look carefully, you'll see that it comes "with mixer,"
and on the page from which I captured the image, the caption
(tr. from Dutch) asks "Yes, Unix WITH mixer! Does linux come with a mixer?"
<p>
For sake of conserving space I cropped out a poster of Khatami,
the relatively moderate President of Iran. Dick remarked in e-mail
that one could detect the political sympathies of shops'
proprietors by seeing which leaders' portraits were displayed.
This one, he observed, was evidently rather liberal, since the more
conservative leaders didn't appear at all.  Other shops
often have smaller pictures of the more conservative leaders,
even if the largest is of Khatami.
<p>
Dick also reports that attempts to engage the shopkeeper about
the fine points of Unix antennas or operating systems failed
for lack of common language.
<p>
Thanks to Wilco Noordermeer for sending the initial pointer.

<img src="unix7image.jpg" alt="Israeli massage appliance" align=left hspace=30 vspace=20>
<p><spacer type=vertical size=100>
Also via Kernighan, there is a scan of
an Israeli ad.  At first we guessed it to be a shower appliance,
but Amos Shapira, reading the Hebrew, corrects this: it says
"The Olympic Massage Machine from Korea has arrived."  He suspects
(and I agree) that it might be a product of Unix Electric Company
from Korea, mentioned below.

<p>

JC van Winkel uncovered a much more extensive Unix massage connection,
specifically a <A href="http://www.thefactoryoutlet.com/massagechair7.htm">
Unix Massage Chair</A>, which claims that "The Unix 501 offers the tapping,
kneading, and rolling massage of a
professional massage therapist."
If this link stops working, a WWW search will
turn up many more suppliers of these chairs.
<p>
Liam Stitt, from Alberta, Canada happened on
this product independently.

<p>
And if you want more personal attention and an actual massage therapist,
the <A href="http://www.bodynmindrelax.com">UNIX Massage Shop</A>, based in
North Hollywood, CA, offers chair massage done by human attendants
instead of gadgetry in the chair.
[regrettably, this place seems to have disappeared from the WWW.]

An ad for Rodenstock Unix eyeglass frames
was captured by Scott Schwartz at his optometrist's office in 1996.
The frames themselves didn't seem appealing, he regrets to
report.
<p>
Maybe they didn't sell well.  www.rodenstock.com does
feature their eyeglass products, but have deemphasized the Unix brand
to the point of invisibility.

<A href="http://www.unix-elec.co.kr">
Unix Electric Company</A> of Korea, in business since 1979,
has a diverse line of appliances for the body, the kitchen,
and the home. One is illustrated here.
I have no idea whether they are a part of a <i>chaebol</i> with
Union Metals, also from Korea (see below), or are just sharing parts
of their company name as well as
the product mark.
<p>
Thanks to Frank Mango for the pointer and the image.
<p>
More recently, Brian Walden (who photographed the peluqueria
in Costa Rica shown below) ordered security cameras for his company,
and they turned out to be shipped from Unix Business Systems,
based, it appears, in Korea, but with a distributor in Los Angeles.
He sent pix of the shipping box and their mailing label,

the elusive WWW sites referring to this product become more
readily accessible.

Bartok Istvan alerted me to the Hungarian auto-parts trading company
<A href="http://www.unixtrade.hu">Unix-Trade</A>; their logo mostly
suppresses the Hungarian or English rendition of <i>-Trade</i> in favor of the Unix part.
<p>
Istvan tells me that Aut&oacute;alkatr&eacute;szek does
mean auto parts, and that their slogan
<i>&Eacute;s az aut&oacute; biztosan megy tov&aacute;bb...</i>

<img src="diapers.jpg" alt="Mexican Diapers" align=left hspace=30>
<p><spacer type=vertical size=50>
Charles Waldman supplied a scan of a package of Unix Diapers.
It came to him from as "something that's been making the rounds
via email, it was forwarded to me by a co-worker..."
The box doesn't discernably mention Pannolini, but the package says "By Drypers" and the
<A href="http://www.drypers.com/welcome.html">Drypers site</A>
shows many distribution points outside continental US, including Puerto Rico,
which could readily explain Spanish packaging.
<p>
A mystery awaited unveiling, so I sent e-mail to the webmaster of
the Drypers WWW site, and received the following response, both satisfyingly
detailed and friendly:
<p><blockquote>
Drypers corporation bought Panollini in 1995. Pannolini previously sold
diapers under the Unix name, and we bought all rights to the name. We have
been selling under the Unix by Drypers logo. Unix is a takeoff on "unisex"
which means diapers for both boys and girls. Prior to 1995 almost all
diapers were sold in boys or girls versions, but all companies switched to
unisex about that time. There are many derivations throughout the world.
Proctor and Gamble sells
"Uni" in many locations, for example. None of this has anything to do with
Unix computers.

Brian Walden photographed this peluqueria (hair salon / barbershop) in
San Jos&eacute;, Costa Rica, in 1994.  He reports that
it had disappeared by 1996, but somehow he has helped confirm
the unexpected association of the Unix name with body-care
technology.  One also suspects the same "unisex" association
made explicitly in the notes on
the diapers above.
<p>
The colored spots aren't Xmas lights; he believes they owe to X-ray
damage to his film at the airport.

From much further south, Wanderlei Antonio Cavassin pointed me
to a similar, but evidently a bigger enterprise in
S&atilde;o Paulo, Brazil: the <A href="http://www.hzta.com.br/unixcabeleireiro">
