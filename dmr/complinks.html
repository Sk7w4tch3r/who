Some places have accumulated material relevant to things I've
been involved with--maybe you got here from there, so it's
only fair to return the compliment.

<ul>
<p>
<li>Steve Summit maintains 
<A href="http://www.eskimo.com/~scs/C-faq/top.html">
a FAQ for the C language</A>, which he's also published
in a book version.  His page has the information.

<p>
<li> There is an eclectic collection of material and pointers
to material about C and other languages
at the <A href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/index.html">
Lysator Society</A> site hosted at Link&ouml;ping University
in Sweden.

<p>

<li><A NAME="oldunix"></A>If you're interested in old Unix systems beyond the
papers saved here (in particular, trying to get them or run them,
whether on
on real hardware, via simulation, or just for study)
look at
<A HREF="http://minnie.tuhs.org/TUHS/index.html">The Unix Heritage
Society</A> site, and the nearby
<A HREF="http://minnie.tuhs.org/PUPS/index.html"> PDP-11 Unix Preservation</A> page.

<p>
The current nominal proprietor of the source code 
for early research Unix systems (5th Edition through 32V)
is named SCO. Today's SCO was previously called Caldera,
Caldera having bought the rights from the earlier
instance of SCO.
This earlier SCO made them available for research and personal
use.  Until recently, Caldera did as well; now their offer
has been withdrawn, presumably for reasons having to do with
their suit against IBM.
An
<A href="calderalicense2000.html">
earlier (2000) version of their license</A> has
evidently been withdrawn; this is a local copy.
There was also a subsequent, less restrictive, license;
its announcement is
<A href="http://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Caldera-license.pdf">
shown here</A> in PDF format.

<p>
In the past, Caldera/SCO coordinated with the TUHS and PUPS group.
The actual sources are well-mirrored in various places.

<p>

The PUPS site has
various emulators, so these systems can be run without a physical machine.

<p>
<li>Tom Van Vleck maintains a fine archive of material at
<A href="http://www.multicians.org">www.multicians.org</A>
about the Multics system.

</ul>

<p>
Some worthwhile sites that annotate and collect even older material are listed
here. They often cross-reference each other, but are big.  These are some
that I've found worth exploring.
<p>
<ul>

<li><img src="new.gif" alt="new">
<A href="http://www.fh-jena.de/~kleine/history/history.html">
Karl Kleine</A> maintains an excellent collection of documents
(language manuals, early patents, machine descriptions):
things like the Algol 60 and A68 reports, various Modulas,
and on and on.
<p>

<li>Manchester University's <A href="http://www.computer50.org/">celebration</A>
of their history.  I would particularly recommend looking at
the <A href="http://www.computer50.org/kgill/mark1/natureart.html">
article in <i>Nature</i></A> magazine of 22 October 1949, which anticipates,
almost eerily, themes seen in computer architecture today.  To excerpt:

<p>
<tt>
<blockquote>
An important feature of any storage system is its accessibility ratio
<p>
    alpha = t1/t2,
<p>
where t1 is the time taken to read a chosen address of the store,
and t2 (>= t1) is the time elapsing between the demand for that
information being made, and the end of the reading process.
<p>
Clearly, it is necessary that the part of the storage to which access is
frequently made should have a value of alpha approaching the
optimum value of unity, if the time taken in solving a problem
is not to be extended by barren periods of waiting. In the electronic
storage system<sup>1</sup> used, alpha = 1. However, it is unnecessary to
have alpha = 1 for all the storage, and, in fact, a magnetic storage
system, for which alpha = 1/133, is used to supplement the electronic system.
</blockquote>
</tt>

<p>The "electronic" storage system was a Williams CRT storage tube;
the "magnetic storage" system referred to a drum memory, which (in this paper)
is later footnoted with a reference to unpublished work by West and Thomas.
We have here both the notion of a storage hierarchy, and, one suspects,
some hardware that wasn't quite working yet.
