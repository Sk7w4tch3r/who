<hr>

Outside of my main professional career, I have accumulated other
WWW-recorded accomplishments and have other interests.
Generally I pursue these interests
using separate mail addresses, SS#, and DNA.
<p>

<ul>
<li>Although my professional truck-driving career was brief,
I did learn enough to do a nearly perfect double-clutch with
a non-synchromesh transmission, while driving up
a hill on a forest track, carrying a bunch of kids in the back
of a dumptruck--the tippable, flat-bed kind, not
one designed to squash garbage.
<p>
This talent (and general cautiousness) seemed sufficient
to garner a nominal association with the
<A href="http://www.ptdi.org/newsletter/newboard.htm">
Swift Transportation company</A> as safety director.
</li>

<p>
<li>
Perhaps this position was gained by
<A href="http://www.markmartin.org/markgood.html">
being a big-rig transporter driver</A> of NASCAR autos to and from races
for the Roush Racing/Valvoline team.
</li>

<p>
<li>I parlayed a stint on the High School AV squad into a side
<A href="http://www.angelfire.com/tn/JillAnne/songs1.html">
career as recording engineer</A>
for rising C&W singers in Nashville,
for example Jill Anne Curington.

</li>
<p>

<li>Similar C&W engineering and artistic talent was
expressed in Brazil as well: I wish you could still see
<A href="http://www.par-ou-impar.com.br/dennis.htm">
www.par-ou-impar.com.br/dennis.htm</A>, which
captured a career as "Diretor/produtor e engenheiro musical,
al&eacute;m de cantor, arranjador, m&uacute;sico, pintor,
cozinheiro, motorista, m&aacute;gico, humorista....
Trabalha com os mais importantes art&iacute;stas da m&uacute;sica
POP e Country, seu talento sem d&aacute;vida
trouxe a este projeto a mais alta qualidade."
All too brief a career, I'm afraid, since the link is now dead.

</li>


<p>
<li>Although my connection with local politics, particularly
those of Republicans in Carlstadt, NJ, has traditionally
been tenuous, and I'm afraid that
my own attendance at <A href="http://www.bergen.org/AAST/Projects/Forum/municipalities/carlstadt.html">
town council meetings</A> is worse than desultory,
nevertheless there was a successful reelection in 1999.
I can assure you that Dennis Ritchie in the
role of Recreation Director remains utterly free of any
taint of nepotism
in connection with Paul Ritchie's appointment as Recycling Director.
</li>

<p>
<li>
I lost an election a while ago in a Kentucky Equine Law
group, but seem to maintain some agricultural roots as
Poultry Division chairman of the
<A href="http://www.arfb.com/commodity/divisions.asp">
Arkansas Farm Bureau</A>

</li>

<!-- <p>
<li>
It really is a good idea to 
<A href="http://tahoe.com/appeal/stories.12.1.99/opinion/ltrr01Dec5858.html">
carry medical insurance ID</A> and be prepared to describe
any special conditions you have,
and I guess this is true in northern Nevada as much as everywhere.
</li>

<p>
<li><b>On the other hand, I, Kernighan, and Prentice-Hall Inc. disclaim
any and all connection with the <i>oeuvre</i> of any music group that dares to call itself
<A href="http://www.blorf.com/su/NID/ndcitejm.html">Stale Urine</A></b>.
