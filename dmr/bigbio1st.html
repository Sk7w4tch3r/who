Dennis M. Ritchie is a researcher in the Convergence, Software, and Computer Science Laboratory
of Bell Labs / Lucent Technologies in Murray Hill, NJ.
Before that, he was in the
now-dissolved <a href="/cm/cs/">Computing Sciences Research Center</a>,
serving for several years as head of its Systems Sciences Research department.
<p>
I was born Sept. 9, 1941 in Bronxville, N.Y., and received
Bachelor's and advanced degrees from Harvard University, where as an
undergraduate I concentrated in Physics and as a graduate student in
Applied Mathematics.  The subject of my 1968 doctoral thesis was
subrecursive hierarchies of functions.

<p>
My undergraduate experience convinced me that I was not smart
enough to be a physicist, and that computers were quite neat.
My graduate school experience convinced me that I was not
smart enough to be an expert in the theory of algorithms
and also that I liked procedural languages better than functional ones.

<p>
I joined Bell Labs in 1967, following my father,
Alistair E. Ritchie,
who had a long career there.
His most visible public accomplishment was
as co-author of <I>The Design of Switching Circuits</I>,
with W. Keister and S. Washburn; it was an influential
book on switching theory and logic design just before
the transistor era.

<p>
Soon after, I contributed to the
Multics project, then a joint effort of Bell Labs,
MIT, and General Electric.
I helped with a compiler for the BCPL language on the Multics machine (GE
645) and on the GE 635 under the GECOS system.  Also, I
wrote the compiler for ALTRAN, a language and system for symbolic
calculation.

<p>
Subsequently, I aided Ken Thompson in creating the Unix
operating system.  After Unix had become well established in the Bell
System and in a number of educational, government and commercial
installations, Steve Johnson and I (helped by Ken) transported the operating
system to the Interdata 8/32, thus demonstrating its
portability, and laying the groundwork for the widespread growth of
Unix:  the Seventh Edition version from the Bell Labs
research group was the basis for commercial
Unix System V and also for the Unix BSD distributions from the
University of California at Berkeley.
The last important technical contribution I made to Unix
was the Streams mechanism for interconnecting devices, protocols,
and applications.

<p>
Early in the development of Unix, I added data types and new
syntax to Thompson's B language, thus producing the new language C.
C was the foundation for the portability of Unix, but it
has become widely used in other contexts as well; much
application and system development for computers of all sizes,
from hand-held to supercomputer, uses it.
There are unified U.S. and international standards for the language,
and it is the basis for Stroustrup's work on its descendant C++.

<p>
Today, as a manager of a small group of researchers, I promote
exploration of distributed operating systems, languages,
and routing/switching hardware.
The recent accomplishments of this group include the
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/plan9">Plan 9 operating system</a>,
which was released in 1995, and the
<a href="http://www.lucent.com/inferno">Inferno operating system</a>,
announced April 1996.

<p>
Awards include:  ACM award for the outstanding paper of 1974 in systems
and languages; IEEE Emmanuel Piore Award (1982), Bell Laboratories
Fellow (1983); Association for Computing Machinery Turing Award
(1983); ACM Software Systems Award (1983); C&amp;C Foundation award of NEC
(1989); IEEE Hamming Medal (1990).
I was elected to the U. S. National Academy of Engineering in 1988.
In April 1999 I received the U. S. National Medal of Technology.
These were all awarded in conjunction with Ken Thompson.

Ken's virtual coat-tails are long. I'm one of the few, besides Bonnie T.,
who has seen him wear a real coat
(and even black tie) on more than one occasion.
