Unix Notes from 1972
</title></head>

<p>
Machine-readable versions of early Unix material are hard
to come by, even for us.  "Backup" in those days (1969
through the early 70s) consisted of punched cards, paper
tapes, or uploading to a Honeywell machine.
We no longer have those cards, tapes, or the Honeywell.
<p>
When we got a PDP-11 around 1971, we did get DECtape, and did save some
material, though not enough.
A few years ago Keith Bostic and Paul Vixie resurrected a
PDP-11 DECtape drive and offered to read any old tapes we
might have around, and I sent several to them.  These notes
are among the small treasures discovered there.
<p>
Two files named "notes1" and "notes2" were on the tape
labelled "DMR",
and their date, if I correctly interpret
the time representation on the tape, is 15 March, 1972.
<p>
I reproduce them below.  I have no
memory of why I wrote them, but they look very much
like something to have in front of me
for a talk somewhere, because of the references to slides.
From the wording at the end
("the public, i.e. other Labs users"), I gather
that it intended to be internal to Bell Labs.
HTML markup and the
corrections and annotations in [] were added in September 1997,
but otherwise it's original.

<h3> notes1 </h3>
<p>
UNIX is a general-purpose timesharing operating system for the Digital
Equipment Corp PDP-11.
<p>
It is the only such system known to me; in any case it is probably the
first.  DEC, in particular, shows no signs of producing a multi-user
system.
<p>
Some history and credits.
<p>
UNIX was written by K. Thompson.  I wrote much of the system software;
Ken most of the rest; Other contributors have been Joe Ossanna, Doug
McIlroy, and Bob Morris.
<p>
The first UNIX was on a PDP-7.  Most features were present, some in
rudimentary form.
<p>
UNIX-11 system was largely written in Jan.-Mar., 1971; since the[n]
changes are generally refinements.
<p>
The charter for the project, and the reason the machine was obtained,
was to develop a document editing and formatting system.  The original
notion was to use UNIX as a development tool only, and have the
editing system run stand alone.
[This is true as it applies to justifying the purchase of the PDP-11.
The earlier work on the PDP-7 just happened in the course of
doing research.]
<p>
It turned out, however, that it was quite practical to have the
editing system run under UNIX, and this is [how it] operates.
<p>
The editing system is now being used by the Patent Division at Murray
Hill to prepare patent applications.  I undertand that the bulk of the
applications are being done by UNIX.  UNIX is also being tried out by
two typists in the MH typing pool.
<p>
At the start I stated that UNIX was a general-purpose time-sharing
system.  I imagine the concept is familiar, but I want to bring out a
few points.
<p>
First, it is general purpose.  This means it may, or may not, be
suitable as a basis for various special-purpose applications.  The two
things that come to mind are management of large data bases and
applications requiring very rapid real time response.
<p>
For several reasons, not all defensible, very large files of
information are not very well handled by the file system proper.  I
will return to this point.
<p>
In the real-time area, the system has no direct hooks to allow a
user-written program to respond very rapidly to an external event.
"very rapidly", here, means in less than about half a second, which is
the approximate time to swap programs off the disk.  There are
thoughts about how to arrange this, but it has not been done.
<p>
Notice, however, that the system does in fact make rapid responses to
events, in the sense that it is able to pick up characters from
typewriter terminals even when they come only a few milliseconds
apart.  Thus if the "real-time" requirement is really that if
collecting characters for a terminal or other machine, that ability is
already there; what may be lacking is the possibility of scheduling a
non-system program which wants to act on those characters within a
very short time.
<p>
So far I have been talking about the disadvantages of the
general-purpose system.  The advantage lies in the ease with which
program development can be done.  With any reasonable number of users,
responses to user's commands is quite fast, and the cycle of
edit-translate-execute-debug is speed-limited by thinking time, not
compute time.  For example, it takes about 50 seconds to assemble and
install a new UNIX system.
<p>
The time-sharing aspect of the system is also vital to a program
development effort, since it means that several people can be using
the machine at once.
<p>
Likewise when the system is adapted to deal with a particular
application, the fact that multi-programming is built in from the
start means that the most subtle problems which come up when several
things must go on at approximately the same time have already been
solved.
<p>
Given that UNIX is excellent for program development, but may have
limitations as a base upon which to build a more specialized system,
the question arises as to the advisibility of writing one's own system
using UNIX.  I can only say that of the several projects using UNIX,
all have in fact decided to use it not only for development but to
support their application directly.  Often some modifications to the
system have proved necessary, however.  Typically these relate,
though, to support of some device the standard UNIX does not provide
for, and to rearranging the management of core memory.
<p>
HARDWARE
<p>
UNIX is running on at least five PDP-11, no two with the same
complement of hardware.  The slide shows the minimal complement
possible.
<p>
The basic requirements above a PDP11 processor are
<ul>
<li>	12 K core
<li>	some kind of disk
<li>	a clock
<li>	an EAE (extended arithmetic element, for multiply/divide
<li>	Some sort of tape, to provide for loading the system software and saving the disk
</ul>
<p>
Above the minimum, it is of course desirable to have more core, lots
of disk, communications interfaces, paper tape reader, and a ROM
containing a bootload program.
<p>
A summary of the devices which have been attached to actual UNIX
systems includes:
<ul>
<li>	DC-11 communications interfaces attached by DATAPHONE to 10, 15, or
30 cps ASCII terminals (not DM-11 as yet)
<li>	RF fixed head disk (256K words)
<li>	RK moving head disk (1.2M words)
<li>	RP moving head disk (2314-style, 10 M words)
<li>	paper tape reader/punch
<li>	201 DATAPHONE interface
<li>	ACU on DATAPHONE
<li>	DECtape
<li>	Magtape (9-track)
<li>	card reader
<li>	line printer
</ul>
<p>
SOFTWARE
<p>
There is a good deal of software that goes along with UNIX.  It should
be pointed out that it was all written using UNIX; none of it comes
from DEC or elsewhere.
<p>
It should also be pointed out that almost all of it is being worked on
in one way or another.  That is while all I will list is usable, there
are a number of things which we regard as desirable that are not
complete.
<p>
The major pieces of UNIX software are:
<ul>
<li>   assembler
<li>   link editor
<li>	text editor
<li>	FORTRAN compiler
<li>	B compiler
<li>	symbolic debugger
<li>	text formatting program
<li>	M6 macro processor
<li>	TMGL compiler-compiler, the last two contributed by Doug McIlroy
<li>	command line interpreter
<li>	many utilities, mostly to deal in one way or another with the file system
</ul>
<p>
SYSTEM
<p>
The system proper can be regarded as falling into three parts: the
file system, the process control system, and the rest.
<p>
I will only talk about the file system in any detail at all.
<p>
Files in UNIX are arranged in a hierarchical, tree shaped structure.
There are two types of object: files, and directories.  A directory is
actually no more than a file, but its contents are controlled by the
system, and the contents are names of other files.  (A directory is
sometimes called a catalog in other systems.)
<p>
Thus we have the type of arrangement shown in the slide: there is a
root directory, which is the "base" of the tree (as usual, the tree is
upside-down) which contains files and directories.
<p>
Each of the directories under the root also can contain files and
directories, and so on.
<p>
In UNIX, files are named by giving a sequence of directories,
separated by slashes, and ending in a file or directory (for example:
...)
<p>
The name of the root is "/", and so it begins the sequence.
<p>
(example...)
<p>
Every user always has a current directory, which belongs to him.
Files can also be named with respect to the current directory, when
the name does not begin with a "/".  (examples: ...)
<p>
It is possible for the same file to appear in several different
directories, under possibly different names.  This feature is called
"linking" (example).
<p>
It is also possible for the directory hierarchy to be split across
several devices.  Thus the system can store a directory, and all [files]
and directories lower than it in the hierarchy, on a device other than
the one on which the root is stored.
<p>
In particular, in our own version of the system, there is a directory
"/usr" which contains all user's directories, and which is stored on a
relatively large, but slow moving head disk, while the othe files are
on the fast but small fixed-head disk.
<br>
<hr>
<h3> notes2 </h3>
<p>
One of the most interesting notions in the file system is the special
file.
<p>
Certain files do not refer to disk files at all, but to I/O devices.
By conve[n]tion, such special files reside in a particular directory,
although this is not necessary.  When a special file is read or
written, the device it refers to is activated.  For example, all the
communications interfaces attached to typewriters have special files
associated with them.  Thus, provided you have permission, anyone can
send a message to another user simply by writing information onto his
typewriter's special file.  There are special files, for example, to
refer to the paper tape reader and punch, to the 201 dataphone, the
console typewriter, and whatever other devices may be on the system.
An effort is made to make these special files behave exactly the same
way that ordinary disk files behave.  This means that programs
generally do not need to know whether they are reading or writing on
some device or on a disk file.
<p>
The system calls to to I/O are designed to be very simple to use as
well as efficient.  There is no notion corresponding to GEFRC on the
Honeywell machines and "access methods" in OS [/360 from IBM] because the direct use
of system entries is so straightforward.
<p>
Files are uniformly regarded as consisting of a stream of bytes; the
system makes no assumptions as to their contents.  Thus the structure
of files is controlled solely by the programs which read and write
them.  A file of ASCII text, for example, consists simply of a stream
of characters delimited by the new-line characters.  The notion of
physical record is fairly well submerged.
<p>
For example, the system entry to read a file has only three arguments:
the file which is being read; the location where the information is to
be placed; and the number of bytes desired.  Likewise the write call
need only specify the file under consideration, th[e] location of the
information, and the number of characters to write.  The system takes
care of splitting the read or written information into physical blocks
as required.
<p>
The I/O calls are also apparently synchronous; that is, for example,
when something is written, so far as the user is concerned, the
writing has already been done.  Actually the system itself contains
buffers which contain the information, so that the physical writing
may actually be delayed.
<p>
There is not distinction between "random" and sequential I/O. The read
and write calls are sequential in that, for example, if you read 100
bytes from a file, the next read call will return bytes starting just
after the last one read.  It is however possible to move the read
pointer around (by means of a "seek" call) so as to read the file in
any order.
<p>
I should say that that it is not always desirable to ignore the fact
of physical record sizes.  Program which reads one character at a
time from a file is clearly at a disadvantage compared to one which
reads many, if only because of system overhead.  Thus I/O bound
programs are well-advised to read and write in multiples of the
physical record size (which happens to be uniformly 512 bytes).  But
it is efficiency, not a logical requirement, which dictates this.
<p>
PROBLEMS
<p>
I mentioned earlier that UNIX was not especially suited to
applications involving vast quantities of data.  The reason is this:
files are limited in size to 64K bytes.  The reason for this is not
particularly defensible, but it has to do with the fact that the
PDP-11 word size is 16 bits.
<p>
There are a couple of ways around this problem.  One of them is simply
to split one large logical file into several smaller actual files.
This approach works for a while.  The limitation here comes from the
fact that directories are searched in a linear fashion.  Thus if the
are a vast number of files, it can become quite time-consuming
tosearch directories to find the files they contain.  We have not
noticed this to be a problem, so far, it is only a worry.
<p>
Another way around the small file size is to use a disk as a special
file.  For various reasons, when an entire disk drive is accessed as a
special file, the size limitation does not occur.  Thus one can set up
a program which manages its own data-- in effect is its own,
special-purpose file system-- and expect reasonable results.
<p>
This again bears on the general versus special purpose system: it
probably is more efficient anyway to do your own data management,
provided the extra labor is worth the cost.
<p>
PROCESS CONTROL
<p>
As I said, the second part of UNIX is that part concerned with process
control.  A process in UNIX is simply the execution of a program.
Each user has at least one process working on his behalf: its task is
to read his typewriter and interpret what he types as commands to the
system to do something.  The program associated with this process is
called the Shell, and it has many valuable features, including the
redirection of I/O, so that you can execute programs which ordinarily
write, for example, on the typewriter, and arrange that their output
go on a file.
<p>
I will not go into any details, except to say that either by use of
the Shell, or from within a program, it is possible to create an
asynchronously running process executing any program designated.
<p>
SUMMARY
<p>
If you are interested in using UNIX, there are a number of points
about which you should be aware.
<p>
First, having to do with the PDP-11 hardware:
<p>
the PDP-11, although probably more powerful that most people realize,
is not a large machine: a PDP-11 can only accommodate 28K 16-bit words
of core.
<p>
Moreover, the 11-20 has no hardware protection features: any user can
at any time crash the system by executing a program with any of an
infinite variety of bugs.  This fact is probably most important during
program development.
<p>
The PDP11/45 essentially solves both of these problems, in a very
cost-effective way-- it is hardly more expensive than an 11/20 when
the total system cost is considered.  It has hardware segmentation and
256K of core can be attached.  Since we will be one of the first to
get and 11/45, there will definitely be a UNIX on it very soon after
it arrives.  (however the date is still uncertain.)
<p>
Perhaps more important is the fact that UNIX is essentially a two-man
operation at present.  Anyone who contemplates a UNIX installation
should have available some fairly sophisticated programming talent if
any modifications planned, as they almost certainly will be.  The
amount of time that we can spend working on behalf of, or even
advising, new UNIX users is limited.  Documentation exists, but never
seems to be complete.
<p>
There have been rumblings from certain departments about taking over
the maintenance of UNIX for the public (i.e., other Labs users) but I
cannot promise anything.
