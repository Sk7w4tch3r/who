<H1>Space Travel: Exploring the solar system and the PDP-7
</H1>
As recounted in 'The Evolution of the Unix Time-sharing System,'
[links are on my <A href="index.html">home page</A>] the game
of Space Travel was written by Ken Thompson, first for GECOS in
interactive batch mode.  I've written a couple of accounts of
it on Usenet or in mail, but haven't fixed it up for the WWW.  Here's an
edited version of one version I saved from 1998. (Since this rendition
isn't particularly historical, I just fixed poor wording instead of
marking changes).

<p>
<hr>
<p>

Ken first did Space Travel on the GE 635, before it had a time-sharing
facility, but it did have an "interactive batch" mechanism.
A job would be submitted, you could type to it, and
there were several locally-built displays attached as peripherals.
It was expensive
to run; a game would cost about $50.  Of course it
was internal "funny money."

<p>

More or less at the same time, Ken discovered the PDP-7,
which had been fitted out with a nice vector display.
The display was a joint Bell Labs and Digital Equipment design,
built by a nearby department as an output
facility for the (then) main IBM 7094 computer.
This PDP-7 Graphics-II system
was much neater than the 635's display, even if older.
The PDP-7 was a real computer, not a peripheral, albeit small even
by 1968 standards.  By then, it was not used much and it was free even
by funny-money standards.
So Ken moved ST to it, and ran the game standalone.  The program
was written from scratch, all in assembly language,
and even including a complete floating-point arithmetic
simulator.

<p>
Also, about this time, Ken again got the urge to write his
own operating system.  He had started on such a project before, but
on a much bigger machine -- the GE 645 Multics machine.
It didn't take long to realize that he couldn't keep the machine.

<p>
Because Ken was now familiar with the '7
and knew he could use it as much as he wanted, the
first version of Unix was written on this PDP-7.
So ST came before Unix, but doing ST led him to a place in which
he could write the first version of Unix.
<p>
The game itself: it was a simulation of the solar system,
to scale, with the true (scaled) orbit sizes and masses
of the planets and most of the moons.  However, it
wasn't a general numerical simulation; instead the bodies
ran on circular tracks at scaled speed in a plane.

<p>
All the bodies had gravity, but it acted only on the rocket ship,
and only the locally strongest-attracting body acted on the ship.
In the simulation, the internal origin for the coordinate system
of the computation
was at the center of this strongest attractor.
This was important for keeping some vague numerical stability
in the calculations (with at best single-precision, software
floating-point), but did lead to some anomalies.

<p>
For example, it turned out that the gravity of Mars (with
the usual inverse-square formula) is dominates that of Phobos until
you get below the surface of Phobos.  So landing on Phobos
was strange-- you sort of floated through its surface, then,
when it became strongest, you snapped back to the surface.

<p>
For controls, there were several buttons: jet forward, jet back, turn left,
turn right; go up scale on the display, go down scale.
The acceleration of the ship was fixed, but it scaled
with the display scale--it was thus fixed in terms
of pixels/sec/sec.

Normally the ship was in the center
of the screen and always pointed up; the display showed the
plan view of the solar system, so that the "rotate"
controls rotated the solar system around you on the display.

<p>
No relativity; scale up enough and you travel to Pluto in
a few seconds.  But don't scale up too much, or you might
not find the Solar System again without restarting.

<p>
The object of the game was simply to fly around, get into
orbits, land.  "Land" meant to cross the surface with a small
enough speed.

<p>
Playing with orbits was fun; how you accelerate to change
the size of the orbit and circularize it isn't very intuitive.
One of the variations was to change the display coordinate system so that
it rotated with the nearest body.  I.e., if you were
orbiting Mercury, the ship and Mercury would always
lie on a horizontal line.  It was also amusing to
crank up the gravity (really, change the timescale)
so that landing was just barely possible.

<p>
Among the features of the program was a built-in debugger
that would continuously display the contents of a selected
location.  This was especially helpful in getting the
software floating-point arithmetic to work.

<p>
The program also displayed the name of the body that
was the current dominating attractor.  As it happens,
Ravi Sethi (of Aho, Sethi, Ullman and other fame, for example
as my former boss and currently as head of Avaya research)
was a summer student: for fun the name of the Sun was Surya,
and Earth's moon Chandra, after their Hindi/Sanskrit names.

<p>
Later we fixed Space Travel so it would run under (PDP-7) Unix
instead of standalone, and  did also a very faithful copy of
the Spacewar game originally done (I think) at MIT on
the PDP-1, but that was a different game.

<p>
The first PDP-11 didn't have a good display,
so the only games were text-based, and were
not very interesting, e.g blackjack.  They were
described in the early Unix manuals.  Of course,
Ken later did a series of chess programs and
hardware that three times won the world
computer chess championship, and was
the first program to attain USCF master level.
