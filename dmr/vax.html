<H2>Historical Perceptions about the VAX architecture
</H2>
As early adopters of the PDP-11 for Unix, we didn't have much
trouble getting early information about Digital's VAX machine.
At some point, probably in early 1977, we had a fairly extensive
briefing on it--several of the designers traveled to Murray
Hill and spent the whole day here.
<p>
Joe Ossanna took extensive and careful notes on the visit, and I wrote
them up in machine readable form; I still have the whole original
file.  The file-system date is 11 Feb 1978, but it must have been
copied or edited a bit after its creation; it was clearly written
before the introduction of the VAX line in October 1977, but also
after work began on the Interdata 8/32 project in early 1977.
<p>
An edited version of our <A href="vax1.html">VAX thoughts</A> is available here.
The sections in [&nbsp;] are notations mostly added in 1988.
<p>
About June 1988, I posted to netnews my 1977 version of Ossanna's notes,
in approximately the same form as linked above.
I also saved the <A href="vax2.html">netnews posting</A>; it's a 10+years-after
critique of our impressions from then.
<p>
The main observation I'd make today is that over the years, Digital
did much better in understanding software than looked likely in 1977
or perhaps even in 1988.
Considering Alpha, I'd say hardware too.
