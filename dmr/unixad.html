<h4>
A Unix Ad
</h4>

Bob Bowles of MediaOne scanned in an ad that appeared in Datamation in 1981.
He mentioned it in Netnews;  I scarfed it and did some resampling
and compression.

<p>
The "positioning" of Bell System (pre-1984 divestiture) research software was always
peculiar.  It was available cheaply in academic/research settings
(where did you think BSD came from?) and was also offered commercially and to the
government, but never quite as a product.  After 1984, AT&T could and
did try to make a business out of this, though it was not hugely successful
for the company. (One of my canned jokes for a while involved the observation
that Ken and I had cost AT&T more money than anyone besides Bill McGowan, but
the reference became increasingly obscure).

<p>
The Greensboro operation that produced this ad is still in operation in Lucent
today (see <a href="http://www.lucentssg.com">the SSG page</a>), but
do not trust the phone numbers or PO box numbers in the ad below.

<p>
I find it hard to interpret or justify the intended meaning of this cartoon.
It appears to be a guy and banknotes being sucked into a computer, which
I suppose does key into the "without costly hardware" headline, but somehow
the whole impression is a bit strange.

The photo for another Unix ad, dated 1980 in the Lucent
archives, is here--I remember seeing it, but not
precisely where.  It does not include the accompanying
copy, though the text in the description probably
approximates it.

The description of the photo is as follows:
<p>

Negative Size: 4x5.   Negative loc: MH

Visual description: This is a photo of wooden building blocks spelling out the
         word unix with different color letters.
<p>
Description: Unix, an easier way to use computers, from a pioneer in
         computing technology, fall 1980 advertisement. Our widely
         accepted UNIX TM operating system is simplifying the use of
         computers. Designed to handle a variety of applications,
         it is being used to manage and maintain the
         telecommunications network, control experiments, develop
         software, process text, prepare documents, and teach
         computer science.  The UNIX system allows users to take
         small programs and assemble the like building blocks to
         perform complex tasks.  In text processing, for example,
         the command Spell Bell Labs Ad, tells a computer to
         proofread this ad against a dictionary filed in its memory.
         The program that performs the task was created by simply
         combining several smaller UNIX programs.

And finally, just to show that there are other forces
in the world, here's another ad.  Scanned and supplied
by Vincent Guyot.  He doesn't have a date; presumably circa
1980.
