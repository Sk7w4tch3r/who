                  modification so developed is intended primarily for the 
                  benefit of a third party and (ii) any copy of any such result,

                  <P>(d) Commercial use by LICENSEE of SOURCE CODE PRODUCTS or

                  equivalent Software License with CALDERA INTERNATIONAL, INC. 
                  before or at the time of furnishing each copy of a DERIVED

                  <P>(b) Each portion of a DERIVED BINARY PRODUCT shall include 
                  an appropriate copyright notice. Such copyright notice may be 
                  the copyright notice or notices appearing in or on the 
                  corresponding portions of the SOURCE CODE PRODUCT on which 
                  such DERIVED BINARY PRODUCT is based or, if copyrightable 
                  changes are made in developing such DERIVED BINARY PRODUCT, a 
                  copyright notice identifying the owner of such changes.</P>

                  <P>5.1 LICENSEE agrees that it will not, without the prior 
                  written consent of CALDERA INTERNATIONAL, INC. , export,

                  technical information or materials covered by this AGREEMENT, 
                  or any immediate product (including processes) produced 
                  directly by the use of any such SOURCE CODE PRODUCTS to any 
                  country that is in violation of U.S. Export Administration 
                  Regulations and/or the export regulations of other countries 
                  unless an appropriate authorization from the U.S. Commerce 
                  Department and any other relevant government authority has 
                  been obtained.</P>
                  <P>5.3 LICENSEE agrees that its obligations under Sections 5.1 
                  and 5.2 shall survive and continue after any termination of

                  <P>6. FEES AND TAXES</P>
                  <P>6.1 The rights granted to LICENSEE for use of the SOURCE 
                  CODE PRODUCTS identified in Section 3 above are granted to 
                  LICENSEE at no charge.</P>
                  <P>6.2 LICENSEE shall pay all taxes (and any related interest 
                  or penalty), however designated, imposed as a result of the 
                  existence or operation of this AGREEMENT, except (i) any tax 
                  imposed upon CALDERA INTERNATIONAL, INC. (or a corporate 
                  affiliate thereof) in the jurisdiction in which LICENSEE is 
                  located if such tax is allowable as a credit against United 
                  States income taxes of CALDERA INTERNATIONAL, INC. (or such an 
                  affiliate) and (ii) any income tax imposed upon CALDERA 
                  INTERNATIONAL, INC. (or such an affiliate) by the United 
                  States or any governmental entity within the United States 
                  proper (the fifty (50) states and the District of Columbia). 
                  To assist in obtaining the credit identified in (i) of this 
                  Section 6.2, LICENSEE shall furnish CALDERA INTERNATIONAL, 
                  INC. with such evidence as may be required by United States 
                  taxing authorities to establish that any such tax has been 
                  paid. If CALDERA INTERNATIONAL, INC. is required to collect a 
                  tax to be paid by LICENSEE, LICENSEE shall pay such tax to 
                  CALDERA INTERNATIONAL, INC. on demand.</P>
                  <P>7. TERM</P>
                  <P>7.1 This AGREEMENT shall become effective on and as of the 
                  date of acceptance of the terms of this AGREEMENT. The initial 
                  term of this AGREEMENT shall be for one (1) year. Thereafter, 
                  the AGREEMENT will automatically renew for successive one (1) 
                  year terms unless either party gives the other, no later than 
                  ninety (90) days before the end of the initial term, or then 
                  current extension, written notice of its intent to terminate 
                  this AGREEMENT. Nothing in this AGREEMENT shall be construed 
                  to require either party to extend this AGREEMENT beyond the 
                  initial term or any subsequent term.</P>
                  <P>7.2 LICENSEE may terminate its rights under this AGREEMENT 
                  by written notice to CALDERA INTERNATIONAL, INC. certifying 
                  that LICENSEE has discontinued use of and returned or 
                  destroyed, at CALDERA INTERNATIONAL, INC.'s option, all copies 
                  of SOURCE CODE PRODUCTS subject to this AGREEMENT.</P>
                  <P>7.3 If LICENSEE fails to fulfill one or more of its 
                  obligations under this AGREEMENT, CALDERA INTERNATIONAL, INC. 
                  may, upon its election and in addition to any other remedies 
                  it might have, at any time terminate all the rights granted by 
                  it hereunder to LICENSEE. Upon such termination LICENSEE shall 
                  immediately discontinue use of and return or destroy, at 
                  CALDERA INTERNATIONAL, INC.'s option, all copies of SOURCE 
                  CODE PRODUCTS in its possession.</P>
                  <P>7.4 In the event of termination of LICENSEE's rights under 
                  Sections 7.2 or 7.3, (i) all fees that LICENSEE has become 
                  obligated to pay shall become immediately due and payable and 
                  (ii) CALDERA INTERNATIONAL, INC. shall have no obligation to 
                  refund any amounts paid to it hereunder.</P>
                  <P>8. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS</P>
                  <P>8.1 This AGREEMENT shall prevail notwithstanding any

                  and other developers shall not be held to any liability with 
                  respect to any claim by LICENSEE, or a third party on account 
                  of, or arising from, the use of any SOURCE CODE PRODUCT.</P>
                  <P>8.3 Neither the execution of this AGREEMENT nor anything in 
                  any SOURCE CODE PRODUCT shall be construed as an obligation

                  to anyone to whom such disclosure is necessary to the use for 
                  which rights are granted hereunder, LICENSEE shall

                  disclosure is made that such disclosure is made in confidence 
                  and shall be kept in confidence and have each such person sign 
                  a confidentiality agreement containing restrictions on 
                  disclosure substantially similar to those set forth

                  <P>If LICENSEE should become aware of a violation of CALDERA 
                  INTERNATIONAL, INC.'s intellectual property and/or proprietary 
                  rights, LICENSEE shall promptly notify CALDERA INTERNATIONAL, 
                  INC. and cooperate with CALDERA INTERNATIONAL, INC. in such 
                  enforcement.</P>
                  <P>If information relating to a SOURCE CODE PRODUCT subject to

                  restriction to the general public by acts not attributable to 
                  LICENSEE, LICENSEE's obligations under this section shall not 
                  apply to such information after such time.</P>
