<h2>Letter from Washington:
<br>
The National Medal of Technology Experience</h2>
<BASE HREF="/who/dmr/">
<h4>
Introduction
</h4>
<p>
On April 26-27 1999, Ken Thompson and I were among those receiving the
1998 National Medal of Technology, together with those awarded the
National Medal of Science, at ceremonies culminating at the White
House.  A great honor for us and Bell Labs, and a lot of fun, even if we had to
behave and wear clothing outside our usual custom. This is
an account of the events.
<p>
The citations and whatnot for all of us
are available from the <A href="http://www.ta.doc.gov/Medal/Recipients.htm">
Department of Commerce</A> and

National Science Foundation.</A>

<h4>
The Runup
</h4>
<p>
The first hint that something was going on was last fall (late
1998), when Ken and I each got a letter with a form from the
government requesting full name, address, date of birth, place of
birth, Social Security number, and signature giving permission for an
FBI name check.  Bill Coughran (boss at the time) confirmed the
suspicion that something was in the works, without going into details.
<p>
The next communication was a mail message (Dec 1) via Paula Cannata:
<blockquote><tt>
        The secretary of commerce called to tell you about an award.
<br>
        He will try back at 3:30pm.
<br>
        Paula
</tt></blockquote>
<p>
For sure, Secretary Daley was successful on his callback.  Over the next few
days, Bill and Dawn Gindel admitted to the amount of preparation that had
been done, with Brian Kernighan, to compile the application.  We began to
get faxes and e-mail with details.  The first version of the press release from
Commerce had my first name as Daniel, but this got fixed before it
went out.
<p>
Over the next few months we got various communications from Allison
Rosenberg, the woman who runs the NMT program within the Commerce Department.
The first word was that the ceremony would be "early 1999" but by January
she was saying "looking at the first two weeks in March."  I called
her about some detail of guests, and in apology for not having a firm
date, she volunteered that "that business in the Senate is
complicating things."  Eventually things were scheduled for 26-27
April.

<p>
The guest issue was interesting.  The first word was that each
medalist could bring, probably, four guests, but depending on space,
that could shrink.  In any event we had to supply the names,
addresses, DOB, POB, SS# of all concerned.  It appeared that all three
of my sibs and their spouses were not merely interested in attending,
but ready to fight for the opportunity.  Ken would bring his wife Bonnie of
course, and he took the initiative to invite Bill Coughran; as a team, it
looked like we were under the tentative limit.  As things worked out,
except for one final point that occurred just at the event, I didn't
have to triage the family.

<p>
So: our own group included <A href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/ken">Ken</A>,
Bonnie, <A href="http://pa.bell-labs.com/~wmc">Bill Coughran</A>
and me, plus my sibs
Lynn, <A href="http://www.lsrhs.net">John</A>,
and <A href="http://www.thinkfun.com">Bill R</A> with
respective spouses
<A href="http://www.bradleygardens.co.uk">Chris Potter</A>,
<A href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1555534368/qid=966482526/sr=1-3/104-6309894-6256748">
Jane Roessner</A>, and
Andrea Barthello.  I had naively thought that Lynn and Chris, for
example, might be diffident about coming from all the way from England,
but this was
very naive indeed.  The relatives were much delighted at
sharing such an event, and from seeing and meeting the families of the others, this
effect isn't unusual. We were surrounded by a collection
of noticeably energized people.

<p>
<h4>
Just Before
</h4>
On the busy Friday before the event appeared a message from Emily Main--
<p>
<blockquote><tt>
  Dennis,
<br>&nbsp;
  A gentleman called from the whitehouse stating that William Ritchie
<br>
  has NOT RSVP'd for Tuesday and that if he does not "he will be
<br>
  standing outside".  This is the number he may call to RSVP to:
<br>
  202-456-XXXX.
</tt></blockquote>
<p>

So I called brother Bill on his cell phone; he was traveling in
Florida.  The phone was off, but his voicemail accepted the message.  I also
called the White House social office, which seemed to accept my proxy
RSVP, and Bill's wife Andrea also called from her trip to Chicago
after indirectly hearing this message.  Andrea had in fact RSVPed
long before, but somehow it didn't register.  In any event, when
the time came, we were all on the list.
<p>
<h4>
The Events
</h4>
Several events went along with the award; some were shared between the
Technology and Science medalists.  On Monday:
<p>
<ul>

<li>A breakfast at the Department of Commerce.  This turned out to
be a stand-up buffet, with introduction of the Technology folk
and the first of several readings of citations that we were to hear
many times.
</li>

<li>
A luncheon at a hotel, hosted by
<A href="http://www.sciam.com/explorations/1998/121498medal/index.html">
Scientific American</A> magazine for the
Technology people, though the Science folk were invited.
John Rennie, the magazine's editor, talked to each of us (all sitting on
a long table at the front with the guests around circular tables).
Each of us had to decide when it was appropriate to eat the salad and
roll, and when to be prepared to say something into the mike.  This
was about the only time when I had, and seized, an on-mike chance to
say good things about Bell Labs and praise collaborators, and I did.
</li>

<li>
The Gala black-tie Banquet at the National Building Museum, which is
a fascinating place architecturally, but whose function as a museum I
wasn't able to figure out, mostly, I suppose, for lack of time to
investigate it.  It was built during and just after the Civil
War, was used to house the War Pensions office, and then fell
into desuetude, but more recently was restored.
The pictures of it at
<A href="http://www.nbm.org"> its home site</A>
don't quite do it justice; it's an impressive space.
</li>

</ul>
<p>
Dealing with this event itself, and handling the social aspects of
interacting with the other medalists and with the very bright and
charming kids from the Banneker High School in DC who formally
escorted us, was more than enough.  The speeches at the event were
pretty banal; A video segment
prepared about us and the each of the others seemed to work at the time.
Our bit had some
old-movie material about A. G. Bell, flash-cut shots about Bell Labs,
and some very earnest and slightly uncomfortable video of Ken and me
when we were considerably younger.  During the introduction to
the ceremonial part, Secretary Daley made some hard-to-interpret
comparisons between the building with its impressive columns,
which are built of bricks inside, and the work of the medalists.
It started by comparing how high a column could be made with
one brick per cardiac procedure performed by Cooley, but became
increasingly forced.  But after all, this was just an after-dinner
speech.
<p>
This event was the chance to get to see Ken and me in most unaccustomed
regalia.  The family took advantage of the opportunity to use their
cameras.
<p>
The last event of Monday was last-minute.  Patrick Regan (Lucent PR
guy) had told me that Lucent was helping to sponsor a concert by
Wynton Marsalis at the Kennedy Center, at the same time as the Gala
Banquet.  He tried to inveigle me into going to that instead of the
banquet.  Reason prevailed: it would be most appropriate to go to the
banquet. This impression was reinforced when several mentioned
disapprovingly that Bill Gates had stiffed the banquet, maybe even the
whole thing, when he received the award some years ago.  This must
have been before he got married.
<p>
But there was going to be a reception after the
concert, so during the Monday luncheon Patrick worked harder at making
arrangements.  Everyone in our group decided that doing Marsalis might
be a good capper to the evening, so Bonnie and my family
called his bluff: how are we to get from the National Building Museum
at 10:15 PM to the Kennedy Center and then back to respective hotels
and my brother's home in Alexandria?  How about providing a limo?  At
first Patrick worried that this would bust his budget for the year,
but after a flurry of conversations on borrowed cell-phones, total
transportation for the evening was arranged.  Cars pulled up in front
of my brother's house just as the last of the cufflinks were being
inserted in rental tux-shirts, and stayed with us to the end.
<p>
The Marsalis reception featured jazz from some highly talented
kids from another DC magnet school.  My group was tired enough to
leave just before Marsalis came back to jam with the kids.
<p>
Tuesday: In the morning, a not-memorable press conference, again at
the Commerce building; there were not many press people there and
there was really only one question asked (which I don't remember) and
the time was spent mostly by the Science medalists riding hobby horses
among themselves, about public underappreciation of science, problems
of the educational system, the fact that many/most of the good young
scientists in the US are immigrants (this tempered by the observation
that most will become citizens), the prevalence of creationism and
crystal-mysticism, and the faults of journalists and scientists
themselves in not combatting all the problems.  Ken tried to change
the tone by observing that one of the problems in the CS area was not
underappreciation but the "eating the seed corn" phenomenon in which
smart people are siphoned off too early from academia and grad school,
but no one picked this up.  After the press thing, I met the family,
we had lunch at a convenient restaurant, and set off for the White
House.
<p>
Tuesday afternoon had the Big Event, the actual presentation by the Prez.
<h4>
Dramatis Personae
</h4>
The larger events included both the Technology and the Science
medalists.  Each of the Science winners were individuals, and so they
were naturally ranked alphabetically when ordering was necessary.  The
Technology ranking was more complicated: first was the individual (Denton
Cooley), the small team (Ken and me), the bigger team of 4 from
Monsanto, then the CEOs of the two corporate awardees (from Biogen and
Bristol-Myers Squibb).
<p>
The medalists didn't have a lot of time to chat during the various
events, because there were constantly directions about what was going
to happen, being told to line up for a photo, and generally dealing
with being in public.  E.g. during the Banquet preparation, how does
one divide time among the Bristol-Myers Squibb guy who confides about
Rich McGinn, the photographer who wants a line-up, the Banneker School
kids, the family who want photos for themselves?
<p>
The English relatives (jokingly) threatened to hiss or make some
demonstration about the Monsanto award; prominent in their citation is
the contribution to genetically modified crops, currently a noisy
topic in Europe and in US-European trade issues.  I wonder what kinds
of discussion went on in the selection committee about this.  In the
event, no pickets or hisses were evident.
<p>
I did manage to connect a bit with Cathleen Morawetz and John Bahcall.
<p>
Cooley somehow seemed to be most prominent--among all the winners,
he's certainly the best known to the public, though he probably
mutters a bit about confusion with Michael DeBakey and Christiaan
Barnard among heart doctors.  He was visible in the whole event not
only by his own fame, but because of his energetic and attractive
retinue: his wife and four daughters.  They are all blonde,
independent, intelligent, personable, and Texan, and were observed
interchanging business cards with my relatives.  Ken managed to
collect a story from Cooley himself, involving a pig used for practice
surgery during his training days: the key lines in it were:
<p>
<blockquote>
        Get the adrenalin!
<br>
        Get the defibrillator!
<br>
        Uh...  Get the barbeque sauce!
</blockquote>
<p>
I bet this is one of his stock stories.  During the SciAm luncheon,
Rennie asked him on-mike about the possibility of a genuinely useful
mechanical heart, and he was dubious (the heart is an amazing organ).
I tried to ask him about xenotransplants, as from a pig, but it was
across Ken on the dais, and either the question or the answer was cut
off by having to do some duty.
<h4>
And Now for the Event
</h4>
The medalists and guests gathered outside the East visitor gate of the
White House around 1:30, warned that seating might be tight.  The
arrangement involved two independent lines.  My relatives and Bonnie
observed that the Denton clan (near the head of the other line) were
moving more aggressively towards the entrance--could it be that the
bonding of last evening was dissolving?
<p>
The next crunch time came when the security guy checking our ID said
that the medalists and their spouses would come in first, other guests
to follow.  Lacking a spouse, I made a quick decision that my sister
Lynn was the one to select for the VIP version of the event.  (I may
have to deal with family consequences from this choice.)  After the name
check and airport-style X-ray machine and metal detector, Lynn and I,
with the other favored folk, got a quick tour of the White House
before being shown the layout of the venue of the ceremony, then going
to the Blue Room of the White House to get lined up for the formal
entrance.
<p>
The lineup was complicated because of the ordering of the S and T
people and because we had to enter the East Room, where the ceremony
would take place, so as not to stumble over each other in sitting
down.  The order was: Science on the right, alphabetically (easy);
Technology on the left, first the individual (Cooley) then the smaller
team (us), the larger team of 4, the two company CEOs.  The
complication was that groups of 6 in each line had to be flipped in
order to file into the seats properly.  The social staff and military
people coped OK.
<p>
Finally we were all arranged properly around the edge of the Blue Room
(the White House has more oval rooms than you would believe).  One
peculiarity was noticed: in the earlier events, everyone was addressed as
"Doctor" irrespective of degrees held.  The White House people in the
Blue Room said "Doctor" to the Science people and "Mister" to the
Technology people.  At some point late in the arrangement, Mrs. Cooley
pointed to her husband and said "It's <i>Doctor Cooley</i>, please!"
<p>
Rush Holt, Congressman from the NJ 12th CD, and the one mentioned by
Clinton in his remarks as the only scientist in Congress (he's a physicist), came by
to say hello.  I thought it was nice that he was invited (or got
himself invited) and made this
gesture.  He's not even from our district.
<p>
The President finally entered, shook hands all around.  He didn't say
anything to Ken or me except maybe a cheery word or so, but he did
spend a moment on Bonnie's necklace.  Bonnie will have to expound on her
perception of this interaction.  He did have a few words with some of
the others (including Cooley).
<p>
After asking an aide "How's this going to be arranged?"  or some
similar question (one we were still asking ourselves in spite of the
instructions), Clinton then retired for a moment.  In the minute or so
before the action began, Cooley remarked, "He does look quite fit, I
think," and he does. Of course Cooley had also remarked to
Ken and me the day before, "I see you two use the same barber."
Not just a surgeon, a diagnostician.

<p>
We all then filed into the East Room without stumbling, sat down and
then stood up for the official, Hail-to-the-Chief entrance.
People who've seen the video of the event tell me that he checked
his fly on entering the room.
<p>
The ceremony came off well. Clinton was, not too surprisingly, the only
person during the whole two-day affair able to deliver a really good
performance in public.  But this is his job, after all.  (I did notice
that he was wearing brown shoes with a gray suit.) You can read what he said at
<A href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/WH/New/html/19990427-4646.html">
the Whitehouse site</A>
[But not any more, as you see if you try to follow the link].
His talk was well-delivered, and he (or his speechwriter)
was more convincing and comforting than Secretary Daley in
admiring and supporting science and technology while disclaiming
personal expertise.
<p>
The relatives, like others, were very curious about whether Hillary
would make an appearance.  There never was a hint that she would, and
she didn't.
<p>
Two crucial instructions well before the whole thing centered on two
points:
<p>
<blockquote>
   RSVP the necessary information about guests into the system,
    or they won't get into the White House!
<p>
   During the presentation,  Don't stand between the President
    and the photographers--you want your picture to be good!
</blockquote>
<p>
<img src="Lucentlow.jpg" alt="Grinning image" align="right" height=228 width=360 units="pixels">
We all seem to have managed this, though Ken and I spent a few
moments pondering that we, as the first team-of-two, were
going to pioneer the exercise of not getting in front of each other.
I succeeded at this, as well as generating an especially
happy expression in one of the shots.  In case you don't
recognize us, that's Ken, me, and Clinton L-to-R.

<p>
After the ceremony there was a reception in the State Dining Room,
without the Prez, but impressive in the catering.  This broke up
slowly and we drifted out, taking advantage of a WH photographer to
get images of us in various places and rooms.  I depend on the family
to follow up to get these.
<p>
As we wandered out, Lynn and I tried to remember what we'd been told
about various rooms to instruct the others, we sat in the WH movie
theater, we took photos here and there.  Late during the exit, we were
favored by the sudden appearance of a guy in a grey jumpsuit with SWAT
written on the back, and festooned with various gadgetry, who let
himself through a door leading to the Jacqueline Kennedy garden.  One
of my relatives was bold enough to ask whether he was there to give us
the tour of the garden.  The reply was friendly but very brisk, and
happily didn't involve a quick move towards his equipment.

<p>
Brother John chose the moment just after the SWAT guy averted his
gaze to flash us a view of a stack of paper towels with the Presidential
Seal he'd abstracted from the rest room.  The White House public rooms
don't seem to have many small knick-knacks sitting about on the tables,
but somewhere in the Federal Budget there is doubtless an item
for Presidential paper towels, and there's no paper detector
on the way out.

<p>
We finished the day with a walk around outside of the whole White
House complex, including observation of Pebble Beach, the gravel place
from which TV crews do their stand-up reports.  This is inside the
fence, but a crew of two with a TV camera and and equipment was sitting on a
sidewalk bench outside.  The relatives engaged them ("Here to cover
the awards?"  "No, we're on a G7 story.")  They were British.  It
turned out that the stand-up guy had used Unix and programmed in C in
University, but was now in TV and had a different gig.
<p>
A satisfying coda to a remarkable experience.
<h4>
Afterward
</h4>
The <A href="http://www.bell-labs.com/news/1999/april/28/1.html">Bell Labs press release</A>
has another photo, and
includes liberal quotations from me.  I'm thankful I managed to slip
in most of the appropriate credits, and appreciation of the real
science that happens at Bell Labs.
