<H2>1988 Netnews posting about 1977 VAX perceptions
</H2>
Here are some latter-day thoughts about the description I wrote of
VAX more than 10 years ago, from a pre-announcement briefing on it.
<p>
Although the instruction set didn't work out as nicely as it seemed it
would, even from the CISC viewpoint, it holds up pretty well.
I certainly don't gush as strongly today, mostly because it
isn't quite as orthogonal as it seemed it would be.  There are
still plenty of special cases lurking in the instructions and address
modes C wants to compile, for example.  The call instructions do
indeed do just what you want, but are too slow.
<p>
Of course the real critique arises not from the details, but from the RISC
insight.  I take this be, in essence, that those address syllables
are expensive to decode, and that the complicated instructions
are bad not because of complication alone, but because they
practically insist on a microcode implementation that RISC is able
to dispense with altogether.
<p>
The analysis of the mapping is correct, and picks out the architectural
weakness of the scheme (no attractive way to do segments) but misses
the small page size.  As I noted in the text, we didn't hear or
weren't told what it was.  Today, 512 bytes is much too small.
Then, I probably wouldn't have thought so.  It's interesting
that the small size persists, though.  DEC must feel that the software
couldn't cope with a change.
<p>
My impressions of the software situation were entirely correct.
<p>
The main fact about the machine that we missed out on altogether
was the IO architecture.  Even the VAX-11/780 had a messy
collection of odd bus adaptors glued on it, and of course the
situation has never really become any better.
