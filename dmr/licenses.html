Prof. Karl Kleine at Fachhochschule Jena in Germany
found and scanned some documents relating to the
distribution of early versions of Unix, and kindly
made them available.

<p>
The first (in PDF form) is the
<A href="licenses/6thEdlicence.pdf">license</A>
issued to Katholieke Universiteit in Nijmegen, The Netherlands,
in December 1974.
They were one of the early educational users, and probably
the same license was used for all the educational organizations
at that time.
Despite the name of the file, from the date of the contract,
the license probably refers to the Fifth
Edition system; the Sixth Edition manual is dated May, 1975.
It's quite possible, however, that it was the 6th Edition that
was actually delivered.

<p>
The license is full of boilerplate, but probably the important
operative clause is that of 4.05, which effectively allows free
use within the university, provided the users do not
disclose outside the organization.
Section 2.01 grants use "for educational and academic purposes
only;" 4.05 requires the licensee not to disclose the
software "or methods and concepts utilized therein,"
to anyone except employees or students as necessary for purposes
granted.
I believe that the wording allowed John Lions to teach
his Unix course and prepare his famous Unix commentary,
but that the terms were tightened up later to be more restrictive
by the time of the Seventh Edition.
However, I understand that the restriction against
disclosing methods or concepts (as distinct from actual
source code) caused ill-ease to some university lawyers.
This restriction was indeed a bit peculiar: the concepts
had already been published, for example in the C. ACM
paper.

<p>
This license was royalty-free, but there was a $150
administrative fee.

<p>

Kleine also found a couple of price lists for software
as of about a decade later.
In particular, there is a schedule for
<A href="licenses/acprice83.pdf">academic/educational</A>
prices as of September 1983; they're uniformly $400 for System III, System V,
32V, Seventh Edition.  These were available
for either the PDP-11 or Vax 11/780 as applicable.
There's no mention of separate charges for multiple CPUs.

<p>
From few months later (February 1984), he found a fuller
(and more expensive) price list for both 
<A href="licenses/pricelist84.pdf">commercial and educational</A>
licenses for System V release 2, plus various unbundled add-ons.
The basic educational charge for the OS has increased
to $800, and there is now a charge for additional CPUs,
even educationally.
I suspect that the 1983 educational schedule still applied,
however, for SIII, SVr1 and the 7th Edition-related releases.

<p>
One other thing is evident in the later price list:
there is a noticeable ($16K) charge for administrative
use even by universities.  This was intended to
handle universities that wanted to use the system
for their internal business (e.g. student registration)
as distinct from teaching and research.

<p>
Kleine maintains an excellent
<A href=http://www.fh-jena.de/~kleine/history>
history page</A>, containing 
scanned documents of early manuals and specifications for Fortran, Algol,
Pascal, and other languages, as well as documentation on several early machines
and technologies.
