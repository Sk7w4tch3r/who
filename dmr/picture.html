An amusing photo
</h3>
</center>
<p>
Here's a publicity photo from about 1972, showing Ken and me
in front of a PDP-11.

<p>
From the right, the major items of equipment are
<p>
<ul>
<li>At the far right, on the table, are what someone discerned
was a VT01A storage-tube display (based on Tek 611) and
a small keyboard for it. Slightly hard to make out.

<li>A main CPU
cabinet, partly behind the table.  The processor is a PDP-11/20;
it must have been our second one, with the Digital Special
Systems KS-11 memory management unit.  Our very first just
said "PDP11," not "11/20."  The arrays of
distorted rectangles above it and in other cabinets are the
labels on DECtape canisters.

<li>Another cabinet.
Careful examination of the image by Steve Westin
detects the top of the bezel of an 11/45 CPU barely peeking
above the TTY to the right of the one Ken is typing at.
A paper tape reader is above it.

<li> The third cabinet sports a dual DECtape drive at the top.

<li>A cabinet with another DECtape drive, probably also containing BA-11
extension boxes within.

<li>A cabinet with RK03 disk drives.  These were made by Diablo
(subsumed by Xerox) and OEMed to Digital.
Digital later began manufacturing their own version (RK05).

<li>A cabinet containing RF11/RS11 controller and
fixed-head disks. By this time / and swap space lived there,
while /usr was on the RK03s.

<li>On top of the machine are what look like magtapes.
A probable TU10 transport is barely visible just below Ken's chin,
at least if you have the monitor brightness and contrast adjusted
favorably.

</ul>

<p>
In front, we have

<ul>

<li>Ken (sitting) and me (standing), both with more luxuriant
and darker hair than we have now.
<br>
<i>Scientific American</i> March 1999 p. 48
should have checked the IDs; we're interchanged in
its caption of this same picture.
<li>
Two Teletype 33 terminals
</ul>
