I.	INTRODUCTION

USL has made no showing of either quantitative or qualitative 
similarity between its 32V code and the University's Net2 software. 
Nonetheless, USL asks this Court to avoid a "morass of issues" and, 
instead, summarily to condemn 4,176 Net2 source code files en 
masse and put out of business one independent company that plans to 
use them. Essentially, USL would have this Court skip the trial and 
proceed directly with the sentence.

In its haste to rush this Court to an erroneous judgment, USL hopes 
to cover up a gaping hole in its copyright claim by virtually ignoring 
it (apparently hoping the Court will do likewise), i.e., USL has ceded 
to the University the copyright in all modifications. improvements 
and enhancements to 32V developed by the University.Thus, even if 
one assumes that USL holds a valid copyright in 32V, USL cannot 
claim that Net2 is an infringing derivative work based upon 32V 
because -- by agreement with AT&T -- the University owns the 
copyright in that derivative work.

As a result of AT&T's grant of ownership to the University of all 
modifications, enhancements and improvements to 32V, USL cannot 
complain that the University's distribution of its Net2 software 
infringes any copyright USL may hold in 32V. While USL may wish to 
complain that the University has breached an agreement not to 
distribute to non-USL licensees any University-owned code that 
"contains" old 32V code, that is a matter of contract law. As the 
Second Joint Declaration of Dr. McKusick and Keith Bostic ("Second 
Joint Decl.") and the Second Declaration of Dr. McKusick ("Second 
McKusick Decl.") explain, there has been no substantial breach of 
that commitment.


USL would lead this Court to believe that Dr. McKusick provided the 
equivalent of a "smoking gun" with his deposition testimony on the 
subject of whether Net2 contains 32V code. In reality, however, 
McKusick's testimony was as explosive as a "pop gun." As Dr. 
McKusick states in his second declaration, his testimony was 
intended to explain the University's treatment of AT&T 32V code for 
which a trade secret possibly could have been asserted: before the 
University would release code that contained a reimplementation of 
a 32V algorithm, the CSRG staff looked forpublic explications of the 
algorithm in question; if an algorithm was publicly describedin 
pseudo-code, the University included the algorithm (implemented by 
improved codedeveloped by the University) in the Net2 release. 
Second McKusick Decl., at Para. 2.3.Header files -- which were 
essential to ensure the compatibility of Net2 withapplications, 
programs and peripherals -- were also included in Net2. Id. at Para. 
4. Itis a gross misuse of the McKusick deposition to represent it as 
an admission ofwidespread incorporation of 32V code in Net2 
because -- in fact -- there is virtuallyno 32V code in the Net2 
source files. Id. at Para. 2.

A painstaking review of the Net2 source code files has uncovered 
only 14 files (out of the total 4,176 Net2 source files) which 
contain any 32V code in them. As explained in the Second McKusick 
Declaration, those files collectively contain only 186 lines of 
common code (out of the 1.5 million lines of source code in Net2). 
Id.at 1 2. In the kernel -- which USL concedes is the core of the 
system -- only 56 lines of source code from Net2 (which has 
230,995 lines of source code in the kernel)match lines from the 
14,293 lines of source code in the 32V kernel. Id. at Para 1.

     After spending hundreds of hours searching for textual matches, 
USL's paid expert could only find and report on two source files in 
Net2 that actually contain 32V code which he considered significant. 
The first, Net2's "ufs_disksubr.c" file contained 14 lines of code (out 
of 358 total lines) that also appeared in 32V. Id. at Para. 2.1.1.

The second example belatedly cited by Dr. Carson in his Reply 
Affidavit, is the "cpio.c" file: this file was included in Net2 by the 
University at the specific request of AT&T. See Second Joint Decl., 
at 1 6.2. But even if it were not estopped to complain about "cpio.c," 
the inclusion of that file and the 14 lines from "ufs_disk.subr.c" -- 
out of the total 1.5 million lines of source code in Net2 -- hardly 
amounts to either copyright infringement or a material breach of the 
agreement not to distribute the University-owned enhancements 
that "contained" 32V code.

In any event, USL's judicial admissions confirm that its claimed 
copyright in 32V has been waived. DeFazio Exhibit F establishes that 
32V was created in 1978. USL's moving papers admitted that 32V 
was published in object code. But -- as the certificate attests -- 
the copyright in 32V was not registered until 1 991, long after the 
five year grace period expired. Although USL may claim copyright 
protection for its current version of Unix (SVR4), any copyright in 
the long-obsolete 32V code was forfeited years ago.

USL's trade secret claim (at least on this record) is wholly 
specious because no specific trade secret has been identified by USL. 
First, insofar as USL would like to claim trade secret protection 
for,the 32V source code in its entirety, the claim is surely 
preempted by the Copyright Act. See 17 U.S.C.  301(a). Indeed, the bar 
of Section 301 (a) is so clear that USL makes no effort to dispute 
the point. Second, to the extent USL's expert claims trade secret 
protection for specific file names or values, Messrs. McKusick and 
Bostic previously demonstrated the documentation of those 
"secrets" in the public domain. USL's predecessor-- AT&T-- had 
agreed that the University need not keep secret "any information or 
technical data relating to the licensed software which is now 
available to the general public or which later becomes available to 
the general public" See DeFazio Decl., Exh. B, Para. 4.07. Even if the 
law recognized a claim where the alleged trade secrets were 
publicly documented (which it does not) it is far too late for USL to 
renege upon the release granted to the University in 1 4.07 of the 
32V license.

Finally, the equities in no way favor USL. As set out in detail in 
the  University's amicus brief and supporting declarations, USL has 
incorporated huge  portions of the University's code into its current 
SVR4 Unix operating system. USL  does not deny that it pays the 
University nothing to use the original code and ~ functionality 
developed by the University, yet it charges over $200,000 per 
license for an operating system that is approximately 50% 
University code. A court sitting in equity cannot condemn a public 
university which has so freely bestowed its gifts upon a private 
corporation simply because it also has made them available for 
other members of the public to use.

II.	ARGUMENT

A.	NET2 IS NOT AN INFRINGING WORK

USL would have the Court believe that McKusick's testimony that 
Net2 contains some 32V code -- regardless of how slight and 
insignificant that code maybe -- is some kind of "trump" card which 
dictates "the end of the case." USL should not be so smug: (1) the 
University's copyright in the derivative Net2 code is an absolute 
defense to USL's copyright claims; (2) USL has made no showing that 
the trivial (and accidental) duplication of 186 lines of 32V source 
code sprinkled among the 1.5 million lines of Net2 source code is 
either quantitatively or qualitatively substantial and its default on 
this critical issue renders it impossible for the Court to find 
infringement of any protectible expression in 32V (even if the 
University were not privileged to create derivative works).

1.	The University Cannot Infringe Its Own Copyright

USL's copyright claim proceeds upon an erroneous syllogism: i.e., 
(1)USL owns the copyright in 32V [fn.1]; (2) Net2 is a derivative 
work based upon 32V; therefore, (3) Net2 (or any program 
incorporating Net2) is an infringing work. The flaw in USL's 
reasoning was hidden from the Court in USL's opening papers but 
revealed by the University's amicus brief and supporting evidence. 
Although parts of Net2 may be derivative programs which enhanced 
and improved 32V, USL expressly granted the University the right to 
create such derivative works and -- furthermore-- granted the 
University ownership of all such derivative works. Accordingly, as 
the copyright certificates attached as Exhibits G and H to the 
DeFazio Declaration attest,the University holds the copyright in the 
BSD code (of which Net2 is a subset).

USL inexcusably failed to bring to the Court's attention the numerous 
written, signed agreements between the parties in which AT&T 
surrendered any claim to joint ownership of the derivative BSD code:

"AT&T does not assert any ownership interest in any
modification or derivative work made by [the University].... "
Karels Decl., Exh. A

* * *

"AT&T-IS claims no ownership interest in any portion of
such modification or derivative work that is not part of a
[AT&T] Software Product." Shapreau Decl., Exh. G.

* * *

"The Regents of the University of California (the University)
is the proprietor and owner of enhancements and additions
to 32V ... AT&T shall have no right, title or interest in or
to such proprietary software...." Towers Decl., Exh. A.

   [fn.1] As the Court is well aware, the issue of whether the 
copyright in 32V has been forfeited is subject to much debate. For 
purposes of this section of the argument, however, the Court may 
assume that USL holds a valid 32V copyright.

The University supplied the omissions in USL's half-told story by 
placing this critical evidence before the Court. Although USL 
dismisses these contracts as mere "wasted paper," the University 
trusts the Court sees their significance. Net2 cannot be an infringing 
work because the creation of the derivative code in Net2 was 
expressly authorized by AT&T and ownership of that derivative code 
was expressly given by AT&T to the University.

Significantly, USL makes no effort to dispute the University's 
ownership of the copyright in the derivative code in Net2. For this 
obvious reason, this case is far different from cases such as SAS 
Institute, Inc. v. S&H Computer Systems. Inc., 605 F. Supp. 816 (M.D. 
Tenn. 1985) where the defendant had no right to create a derivative 
work, much less ownership of the copyright in such derivative work.  
Essentially, USL asks this Court to find the University has infringed 
its own copyright; that is a legal impossibility which the Court 
should not pause long to consider. [fn2]

  [fn2]  The question of whether the Net2 software contains any 
significant portion of 27 | 32V code is a "red herring" in the context 
of USL's copyright claim because the University owns all of the 
derivative code it developed, including those 14 files (out of
4,176 Net2 files) which contain a smattering of original 32V code. 
USL may attempt to seek remedies under contract law for any 
material breach of the University's agreement not to distribute 
University-owned derivative programs which "contain" 32V code but 
USL has no copyright claim against Net2.

B.	DE MINIMIS "LITERAL COPYING" DOES NOT PROVE INFRINGEMENT

In Universal Athletic Sales Co. v. Salkeld, 511 F.2d 904 (3rd Cir. 
1975), the Third Circuit recognized the rule for cases (such as this 
one) of de minimis similarity:"[I]f the points of dissimilarity not 
only exceed the points of  similarity, but indicate that the remaining 
points of similarity are (within the context of plaintiff's work) of 
minimal importance either quantitatively or qualitatively then no 
infringement results."511 F.2d at 909 n.4. Reversing a preliminary 
injunction, the Court of Appeals recognized that mere copying is 
not enough to prove infringement: "substantial similarity to show 
that the original work has been copied is not the same as substantial 
similarity to prove infringement." 511 F.2d at 911.  USL must prove 
similarities between 32V and Net2 that are quantitatively or 
qualitatively substantial. Thus, USL's assertion that proof of trivial 
copying "establishes literal copyright infringement" and "renders 
unnecessary the substantial similarity analysis" is plain wrong. See 
Narell v. Freeman, 872 F.2d 907, 910 (9th Cir. 1989) ("A finding that 
a defendant copied a plaintiff's work, without application of a 
substantial similarity analysis, has been made only when the 
defendant has engaged in virtual duplication of a plaintiff's entire 
work.")

USL has established neither quantitative nor qualitative 
substantiality on this motion. First, the 14 lines of common source 
code, the few common file names and two common comments are 
quantitatively de minimis. See Joint Decl., at 11 13, 28,39, and 47; 
Second Joint Decl., at 114, 6; Second McKusick Decl., at 12. 
Second,USL has made no effort to explain why -- qualitatively -- the 
14 lines of common code (out of 1.5 million) or two comments (out 
of 33,350) are so important to either it or the University's work as 
to justify a finding of infringement. The only evidence before this 
Court is that the common code is insignificant and easily could be 
replaced and that the comments are automatically omitted from the 
program once it is compiled. Second Joint Decl., at 11 6.1, 6.2. This 
trivial, fragmented (and accidental, Second McKusick Decl., at 1 5) 
duplication of code/comments is insufficient to establish 
infringement. [fn3]

  [fn3] Compare, Feder v. Videotrip Corp., 697 F. Supp. 1165, 1176 (D. 
Colo. 1988) ("If, however, the similarity is only as to non-essential 
matters, then a finding of no substantial similarity should result... 
thus the Courts have applied a de minimis standard in ruling that 
some similarities, while suspect, may be too insignificant to arise 
to the level of 'substantial."'); Werlin v. Reader's Digest Assoc., Inc., 
528 F. Supp.464 (S.D.N.Y. 1981) ("the Court finds the literal 
duplication that occurred hereto be so fragmented as to be de 
minimis, and accordingly declines to rely on this similarity to find 
copyright infringement."); Rokeach v. Avco Embassy Pictures Corp., 
1097 U.S.P.Q. 156, 161 (S.D.N.Y. 1977) (one hundred words out of 
70,000 a de minimis taking); R.L. Polk & Co. v. Musser, 105 F. Supp. 
351, 353 (E.D. Penn. 1952)(less than one-half of one percent of a 
work being copied "was trivial and inconsequential").USL's citation 
of Harper & Row Publisher's. Inc. v. The Nation, 471U.S. 539 (1985) is 
off point because the misappropriated text was qualitatively the 
most important part of plaintiff's work.

C.	USL CANNOT DISTINGUISH ATARI GAMES AND COMPUTER 
	ASSOCIATES

USL misuses the opinion in Lotus Development Corp. v. Borland 
International Inc., 799 F. Supp. 203 (D. Mass. 1992). That case 
addresses duplication of a "user interface," i.e., the screen display 
generated by a program and the keystrokes used to operate it. 
Borland argued that its emulation of Lotus' screen display, menu 
structure and keystroke sequences were justified because people 
were familiar with Lotus 1-2-3, and therefore it had become a 
"standard." 

This case is far different. It does not involve mere user interfaces 
with which the public has become comfortable; this case deals with 
technical requirements. If certain header files, symbols or function 
names are not included in a system, that system simply will not 
work with certain applications programs or peripherals. See Joint 
Decl., at 1 28.3, 1 47. Thus, unlike Lotus, this case falls squarely 
within the description of the unprotected elements of a computer 
program set forth only a few months ago by the Federal Circuit: the 
unprotected elements of a computer program include "expression 
dictated by external factors (like the computer's mechanical 
specifications, compatibility with other programs, and demands of 
the industry served by the program) ..." Atari Games Corp. v. Nintendo 
of America. Inc., F.2d 24 U.S.P.Q.2d 1015, 1020 (Fed. Cir. 1992). See 
also Computer Assoc. International, Inc. v. Altai. Inc.,  __F.2d ___, 
1992, 23 U.S.P.Q.2d 1241, 1252-3 (2nd Cir. 1992); Brown Bag 
Software v. Symantec, 960 F.2d 1465, 1475-6 (9th Cir. 1992); Apple 
Computer v. Microsoft Corp., 799 F.Supp. 1006, 1020-21 (N.D. Cal. 
1992).

USL's effort to distinguish Atari Games and Computer Assoc. is off 
base:  contrary to USL's reading of those cases, they do not turn on 
when the infringed program was created. Indeed, the CONTU Report 
explicitly acknowledges that an  original program may lose 
copyright protection under circumstances such as those presented 
here.

"[C]omputer programs are, in essence, utilitarian articles - articles 
that accomplish tasks. As such they contain many logical, 
structural, and visual display elements that are dictated by the 
function to be performed, by considerations of efficiency, or by 
external factors such as compatibility requirements and industry 
demands. [citing Computer Assoc.] In some circumstances, even the 
exact set of commands used by the programmer is deemed functional 
rather than creative for purposes of copyright. When specific 
instructions. even though previously copyrighted. are the only and 
essential means of accomplishing a given task. their later use by 
another will not amount to infringement."

Sega Enterprises. Ltd. v. Accolade, Inc., ___F.2d___, slip op. at 41. 
(9th Cir. 1993) (as amended), quoting CONTU Report at 20. All of the 
recent cases and the legislative history as set forth in the CONTU 
Report recognize that when the copyright holder's program was 
created is not important; what is important is whether the code in 
the accused work is "dictated by external factors." As explained in 
detail in the First Joint Declaration and the Second Joint 
Declaration, the header file names and symbols that are common to 
32V and Net2 are required by the need for "compatibility with other 
programs and demands of the industry served by the program." Atari 
Games, supra. As such, they are not protectible by USL's claimed 
copyright in 32V.


D.	USL FORFEITED ITS COPYRIGHT IN 32V

USL forfeited its copyright in 32V when it globally published 32V 
without a copyright notice and failed to timely cure the notice 
defect. USL's use of the limited publication argument to escape the 
consequences of its conduct stretches the bounds of the limited 
publication doctrine beyond all reasonable parameters in light of 
USL's admissions that:

	32V was created in 1978 (DeFazio Decl., Exh. F);

	32V was distributed in source and object code to thousands of
	licensees around the world (Exh. M and 0 to Forte Aff.; Greene
	Depo., at 82:20; 83:7-9 attached to the Shapreau Decl.);

	USL published 32V in object code (USL's Moving Papers at 11
	and 27 and Reply at page 5 footnote 10 and page 10, first
	bullet);[fn4]

	USL failed to affix copyright notices to its 32V UNIX operating
	system in both source and object code until 1984 (Pfeffer 
	Decl.,at Paras 4-5;[fn5] see also McKusick Decl., at Para. 5 and 
	Joint Decl., at Para 28.4; Exhibit A attached to the Second 
	Shapreau Decl. and Shapreau Decl., at 12; compare Exhibit A 
	attached to the Second Karels Decl. and Karels Decl., at Para. 
	2)[fn6] and

	USL failed to register 32V until 14 years after it first 
	published this work. DeFazio Aff., Exh. F.

USL is mistaken when it claims that the University has not looked in 
the proper place for USL's missing copyright notices. The University 
has looked at a copy of the container for the source code version of 
32V and found no copyright notice affixed. Exhibit A, attached to the 
Second Shapreau Decl.; see also McKusick Decl., at 1 5. In addition, 
the header files contained in the object code version of 32V have 
likewise


   [fn4] USL does not dispute the University's legal argument and 
authority that the source and object code for 32V are but one work.

   [fn5] USL's Mr. Pfeffer has admitted that:

	No copyright notice was included in those [object code] files 
	in order to avoid any possible implication that AT&T had 
	"published" these files so as to deprive them of their trade 
	secret status. Pfeffer Decl., at Para. 4. In 1984,when AT&T 
	initiated its general purpose computer business, it decided 
	that the binary code which it was planning to provide with 
	such computers should bear a copyright notice in the name of 
	AT&T." Id. at Para. 5.

   [fn6] USL erroneously contends in footnote 10 of its Reply that 
because the copyright notice requirements have been removed from 
post-Berne Convention Implementation Act works, that USL should 
be relieved of the statutory requirements of the 1976 Copyright Act. 
If Congress had intended the Berne Convention Implementation Act 
to be retroactive, it would have provided for such a result. Instead, 
Congress specifically required that copyright notice be affixed to 
"copies...publicly distributed ...before the effective date of the Berne 
Convention Implementation Act of 1988...." 17 U.S.C. Section 405(a).

SUPPLEMENTAL AMICUS BRIEF BY DEFENDANT THE REGENTS	10

entered the public domain as a result of publication without 
copyright notice. Joint Decl., at 1 28.4; see also Second Karels Decl., 
and Exhibit A attached thereto.i

Moreover, USL's reliance on Exhibits 1-4 attached to the Weitz Reply 
Aff., as evidence that copyright notices were properly affixed to its 
32V code is nothing short of ridiculous, in light of the fact that 
Exhibits 1-4 are not versions of 32V and are, therefore, irrelevant.~ 
Moreover, Sun Microsystems copyright notices, affixed to Exhibits 
1-2, did not transform 32V, which had already entered the public 
domain, into a properly copyrighted work.9

USL incorrectly claims at footnote 21 that a copyright notice in a 
derivative work is "deemed notice of the copyright in all underlying 
works." As Nimmer has pointed out:

if the underlying work itself had previously been published without a 
copyright notice, then a derivative work incorporating such pre-
existing work cannot, under any circumstances regardless of the 
notice used,serve to revive the pre-existing work, which had 
theretofore entered the public domain. Nimmer, Nimmer On 
Copyright, 7.12[C], at 7-100.1(1992) .

   [fn7] USL's citation to Koontz v. Jaffarian, 787 F.2d 906, 909-910 
(4th Cir. 1986) does not support its copyright notice argument 
because even if USL had provided reasonable copyright notice for its 
code within its 32V manual (which it did not), no notice existed 
whatsoever for the multitude of copies of 32V code distributed 
through Western Electric and AT&T's source code exchange program, 
in which copies of 32V were exchanged without a manual.

Moreover, in the case of a time-sharing system such as 32V, it is 
highly doubtful whether a copyright notice affixed to a manual or 
to packaging would give reasonable notice of the claim of 
copyright under 17 U.S.C. Section 401(c); see also Nimmer, Nimmer
on Copyright,  7.10[A][1], at 7-69 (1992)..

   [fn8] The University does not contend that USL's forfeiture of its 
copyright in the antiquated, outdated 32V version of the Unix 
operating system constitutes a forfeiture of USL's copyright in 
subsequent versions of the UNIX operating system which contain new 
code. Therefore, copyright notices contained in System III and V code 
are not germane to this litigation

   [fn9] The University's copy of the copyright notice purportedly 
affixed to Exhibit 4 attached to the Weitz Aff. is not legible and 
Exhibit 3 does not appear to contain any copyright notice.


Moreover, if USL had carefully read Stewart v. Abend, 495 U.S. 207 
(1990), cited by USL, it would have discovered that the case involved 
the issue of whether the owner of a derivative work infringed the 
rights of a successor owner of the preexisting work by continued 
distribution and publication of the derivative work during the 
renewal term of the pre-existing work. In fact the Supreme Court 
quoted the

'well-established doctrine that a derivative copyright protects only 
the new material contained in the derivative work, not the matter 
derived from the underlying work.' Stewart v. Abend 495 U.S. 207, 
223 (1990) quoting, Russell v. Price, 612 F.2d 1123, 1128 (9th Cir. 
1979), cert denied, 446 U.S. 952 (1980).

In fact, the Copyright Act itself addresses this very issue in Section 
103(b) which provides:

The copyright in a compilation or derivative work extends only to 
the material contributed by the author of such work, as 
distinguished from the preexisting material employed in the work, 
and does not imply any exclusive right in the preexisting material. 
The copyright in such work is independent of, and does not affect or 
enlarge the scope, duration, ownership, or subsistence of, any 
copyright protection in the preexisting material. 17 U.S.C. Section 
103(b).

Accordingly, USL's widespread distribution of 32V without a 
copyright notice has injected 32V into the public domain.

1.	Congress' Definition of Publication Under The 1976 Copyright 
	Act Does Not Alter USL's Forfeiture of its Copyright in 32V

USL mistakenly contends that under the 1976 Copyright Act its 
"contractual restrictions [alone] negate any requirement of notice" 
(Moving Papers, at 6 and 7). USL's incredible contention that the 
"selected group" requirement no longer exists under the 1976 Act is 
unsupported by the Copyright Act, cases construing it and the 
commentators. [fn10]  

  [fn10] USL suggests that cases which continue to apply the three 
part test promulgated in Kimmell are "patently inconsistent with 
the intent of Congress and should not be followed." Moving Papers at 
8.  USL does not cite one single case to support its rather unique 
legal position.  Instead, USL cites a "work for hire" case hoping that 
will do.

For example, Goldstein, in The Law of Copyright, analyzes the House 
Report discussion of limited publication in the 1976 Act, which 
characterizes the "public" as "persons under no explicit or implicit  
restrictions with respect. to disclosure of [a work's]  contents," 
[fn11] in which Goldstein states:

Congress arguably intended to drop the first element of the test 
employed under the 1909 Act [the selected group requirement].  But 
the reference to restrictions on "disclosure," rather than to 
restrictions on "copying" as required under the 1909 Act, suggests 
that Congress probably contemplated distribution to a limited group 
beyond which thework would not be disclosed. Courts have adopted 
this construction....  (citations omitted, emphasis added). Goldstein, 
Copyright, Section 3.3.1, at 258; see also Nimmer, The Law of 
Copyright, Section 4.13[B], at 4-72-73 and the cases cited therein.

  [fn11] H.R. Rep. No. 1746, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 138 (1976).

Furthermore, USL is confused when it cites to the legislative history 
to support its contention that Congress adopted the definition of 
"publication" in the1976 Act because it viewed the common law 
definition of "publication" (as crystallized in White v. Kimmell, 193 
F.2d 744, 746-747 (9th Cir. 1952) as "defective."  Moving Papers, at 
6-7, quoting,  H.R.Rep. No. 1476, 94th Cong., Second Session, 129-
130 (1976).  The House Report to which USL selectively cites at 
pages 129-130 discusses "publication" in the context of preemption 
of common law copyright claims under Section 301 of the 1976 Act 
and the need for national uniformity in copyright protection, as well 
as the change in the nature of "publications" in light of the 20th 
Century communications revolution. The legislative history does not, 
as USL suggests, criticize the three part test used by the courts to 
determine when a "limited publication" occurs. [fn12]

  [fn12] Reference to other sections of the 1976 Copyright Act, and 
its legislative history,  which focus on the issue of when copyright 
interests are implicated by public distribution, (although not on 
point) may aid the Court in its determination of whether 32V has 
been distributed beyond a "selected group."  For example, the 
Copyright Act makes clear that a copyright will not be invalidated if 
copyright "notice has been omitted from no more than a relatively 
small number of copies... distributed to the public....17 U.S.C. Section 
405(a) (emphasis added).
  In addition, under clause (1) of the definition of "publicly" in 
section 101 (the definitions section of the Act) a performance or 
display is "public" if it takes place "at a place open to the public or 
at any place where a substantial number of persons outside of a 
normal circle of a family and its social acquaintances is gathered." 
H.R. Rep. No. 1746, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. at 64 (1976).


2.	USL Distributed 32V Well Beyond A Selected Group

As amply discussed in the University's Amicus Brief at 28:1-29:16, 
USL has failed to meet the "selected group" requirement. The cases 
cited by USL do not undercut the University's facts and law which 
demonstrate that USL has published 32V to a non-selected group. 
Both Paramount Pictures Corp. v. Rubinowitz, 217 U.S.P.Q. 48 (E.D. 
N.Y. 1981) and National Broadcasting Co., Inc. v. Sonneborn, 630 
F.Supp. 524 (D. Conn. 1985), arose under the 1909 Act and the courts' 
discussion of the 1976 Act is mere dicta.  However, neither of these 
opinions states that the selected group requirement does not exist 
under the 1976 Act. [fn13]   PRC Realty Systems v.National Ass'n of 
Realtors, 766 F.Supp. 453, 461 (E.D. Va. 1991 ), rev'd in part without 
opinion, 972 F.2d 341 (1992), summarily disposes of the publication 
issue without any discussion of the change in the publication 
analysis in the 1976 Act with respect to the selected group 
requirement. Therefore, because USL cannot satisfy the selected 
group requirement, its limited publication argument must fail.

...[fn13]  Moreover, in National Broadcasting Co.. Inc. v. Sonneborn, 
630 F.Supp. 524 (D. Conn. 1985), the court noted that "[t]he number of 
persons with the technical ability to broadcast or copy 'Peter Pan' 
was relatively small in the early to mid 1960's." Id. at 536. This 
comment indicates that had a large number of individuals had 
sufficient technical ability to copy or broadcast the work, a general 
publication might occur.

3.	USL Did Not Distribute 32V For A Limited Purpose

USL fails to address the "limited purpose" requirement which 
focuses on the publisher's conduct (not on restrictions placed on the 
recipient of the work) and requires that the publication be for a 
limited purpose, such as review, criticism, promotion, education, or 
performance. Instead, USL contends that one of the general purposes 
of the copyright law, i.e., to encourage creativity by enabling 
copyright authors to profit from their work, is sufficient to meet 
this requirement; it is not. See the University's Amicus Brief, at 
30:15-31:18 and cases cited therein.  As such, USL's limited purpose 
argument falls short of meeting the required showing of a limited 
purpose in its publication of 32V.


CONCLUSION

For all of the foregoing reasons, this Court should rule that Net2 is 
not an infringing work even if USL possess a valid copyright in 32V. 
Nor should the Court find that the University misappropriated any 
trade secrets by releasing Net2.
