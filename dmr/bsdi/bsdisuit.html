<h2>
USL vs. BSDI documents
</h2>
<p>
In view of the interest in the newly-launched suit
by SCO against IBM, I thought it might be of interest
to make available some of the documents from an earlier
case.
Here USL, at the time the owner of a predecessor
of the intellectual property now controlled by SCO,
sued BSD Incorporated. The University
of California was added to the suit soon after it began.
<p>
These files were obtained via FTP
from the UUNET server in 1992 and 1993 (that is,
at times approximately corresponding to the
dates encoded in their names).  I picked up all
the things that seemed relevant.  Similarly,
UUNET may have chosen documents, from those publicly
available, that seemed relevant
to them.  UUNET and BSDI had significant relationships.
<p>
The files are as I found them.  There are some strange
characters in them; whether these result from an OCR
process or character-set strangeness in computer originals
I do not know.
<p>
Some of the records in the case apparently remain sealed,
in particular I have never seen the details of the
final settlement, which occurred after Judge Debevoise
did not grant the injunction that USL sought.
<p>
These files are absolutely plain text (not HTML, and with just NL
characters separating lines).  They seem to show up OK
in browsers.  I tacked on a ".txt" to the actual
file names.
<p>
In what seems to be reverse chronological order,
the files follow: the ruling, listed first, is perhaps most
relevant.

Frank Sorenson has more recently turned up
the docket for the case; it's visible here
(and also at http://sco.tuxrocks.com):

</UL>
The case continued for some months after the
documents listed at the top, and there were
further decisions over the summer of 1993, turned up by Sorenson.
These are references to his archive.  The first listed
appears to be the same as the 930303.ruling above, but it
is in HTML, and contains footnotes not in the earlier
version I collected:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://sco.tuxrocks.com/Docs/USL/Doc-92.html">March 3 ruling</a>
<li>
<a href="http://sco.tuxrocks.com/Docs/USL/Doc-112.html">March 30 ruling</a>
<li>
<a href="http://sco.tuxrocks.com/Docs/USL/Doc-137.html">June 29 ruling</a>
<li>
<a href="http://sco.tuxrocks.com/Docs/USL/Doc-150.html">September 7 ruling</a>
</ul>
<p>
After the March ruling, the Regents of the University of California
filed a separate suit in
the California state court system.  The University's complaint,
kindly supplied by Harlan Wilkerson and Frank Sorenson, is here, as is
a license from UCB to AT&T:

<a href="930610.ucb_complaint.txt">The UC Regents' Complaint</a>
<li>
<a href="BSD_ATT_License.pdf">UC's license to AT&T</A>
for use of BSD materials in SV.
This is a largish PDF scan of the 1986 license.  Also
available is a
<a href="BSD_ATT_License.txt"> plain-text transcription</A>,
supplied by Pamela Jones of Groklaw via Wilkerson.

A Groklaw contributor, one 'dburns', recently (Dec 2004) obtained
a copy of the settlement (signed 2/4/1994) between USL and UCB
of the matter: the
<A href="USLsettlement.pdf">PDF version</A> of the
whole thing is copied here; the Groklaw
site (www.groklaw.com) has a text rendition and
their commentary.
My own commentary is just that it contains no surprises,
but is good to have.
