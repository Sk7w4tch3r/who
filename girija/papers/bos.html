<strong>Abstract:</strong> <p>
A key issue for parallel systems is the development of useful programming
abstractions that can coexist with good performance.  We describe a 
communication library that supports an object-based abstraction with a 
bulk-synchronous communication style; this is the first time such a library
has been proposed and implemented.  By restricting the library to the
exclusive use of barrier synchronization, we are able to design a simple and
easy-to-use object system.  By exploiting established techniques based on
the bulk-synchronous parallel (BSP) model, we are able to design algorithms
and library implementations that work well across platforms.
