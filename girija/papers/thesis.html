<strong>Abstract:</strong> <p>


The goal of high-level parallel programming models or languages is to 
facilitate the writing of well-structured, simple and portable code.
However, the performance of a program written using a high-level language may
vary significantly, depending on the implementation of the underlying system.

<p>
This dissertation presents two asynchronous scheduling algorithms that
provide worst-case upper bounds on the space and time requirements of 
high-level,  nested-parallel programs on shared memory machines. 
In particular,  for a program with <i>D</i> depth and a serial space 
requirement of <i>S<sub>1</sub></i>, 
both algorithms guarantee a space bound of 
<i>S<sub>1</sub> + O(K . p . D)</i> on <i>p</i> processors. 
Here, <i>K</i> is a user-controllable runtime parameter, which
specifies the amount of memory a thread may allocate before being preempted
by the scheduler. 
Typically, in practice, <i>K</i> is fixed to be a few thousand bytes.
Most parallel programs have a small depth <i>D</i>. 
For such programs,
the above space bound
is lower than the space bound provided by any previously implemented system.

<p>
The first of the two scheduling algorithms presented in this dissertation,
algorithm <i>AsyncDF</i>, prioritizes threads at runtime 
by their serial, depth-first execution order, and preempts threads 
before they allocate too much memory.  This ensures that the parallel
execution does not require too much more memory than the serial execution.
The second scheduling algorithm, <i>DFDeques</i>, enhances algorithm <i>AsyncDF</i> 
by adding ideas from work stealing.  
It replaces the single, flat priority queue of <i>AsyncDF</i> with
ordered,  per-processor queues of ready threads, and allows some deviation
from the depth-first priorities while scheduling threads. 
Consequently, it results in lower scheduling overheads 
and better locality than <i>AsyncDF</i> for finer-grained threads, at the
cost of a slight increase in memory requirement.
To ensure scalability with the number of processors, I also describe 
and analyze fully parallelized versions of the schedulers for both the
algorithms.

<p>
To verify that the theoretically-efficient scheduling algorithms are
also practical, 
I have implemented them in the context of two multithreaded runtime systems,
including a commercial Pthreads package.
Parallel benchmarks used to evaluate the schedulers
include numerical codes, physical simulations and a data classifier.
Experimental results indicate that my algorithms effectively reduce 
memory usage compared to previous techniques, without
compromising time performance. 
In particular, my schedulers allow simple, high-level, fine-grained
benchmarks to run as efficiently as their more complex, 
hand-partitioned, coarse-grained counterparts. 
As expected,  <i>DFDeques</i> achieves better  speedups than <i>AsyncDF</i> for finer-grained
threads. It requires more memory than <i>AsyncDF</i>, but
less memory compared to previous schedulers.
The scheduling algorithms were extended to support the full Pthreads interface,
making them available to a large class of applications with irregular and 
dynamic parallelism.
Both the <i>AsyncDF</i> and <i>DFDeques</i>  algorithms provide a user-adjustable 
trade-off between running time and memory requirement, which I
analyze and experimentally demonstrate.
