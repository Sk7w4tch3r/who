<p>Eigensolve is a program that approximates the roots of a univariate
polynomial.&nbsp;&nbsp; The algorithm is described in the paper&nbsp; <a href="ieaarup.ps.gz">An
iterated eigenvalue algorithm for approximating the roots of univariate
polynomials</a> (an earlier
<br>version appeared in&nbsp;ISSAC 2001).

This image shows the iterations of the algorithm on the Wilkinson polynomial
of degree 320.&nbsp; The initial iteration is in blue, followed by red,
green, yellow, magenta, and cyan.&nbsp; The roots are the integers from
1 to 320, i.e. the black line in the center of the image.&nbsp; Each iteration
is computed using a floating-point eigenvalue computation.&nbsp; The first
eigenvalue computation uses the ordinary Sylvester companion matrix.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Subsequent iterations use a generalized companion matrix constructed using
the values of the polynomial at the previous iterate.&nbsp; This computation
required 7 eigenvalue computations and took about 87 seconds (on a 250
Mhz SGI R10000, with roots reported to 15 decimal digits).&nbsp; Here is
a <a href="eigensolvealgorithm.html">description</a> of the algorithm and
other examples of <a href="eigenvalueiterexamples.html">iterations.</a>
<p>Eigensolve accepts polynomials in the same file format as the program
MPSolve, written by <a href="http://fibonacci.dm.unipi.it/~bini/ric.html">Dario
Bini</a> and Giuseppe Fiorentini (<a href="ftp://ftp.dm.unipi.it/pub/mpsolve/MPSolve-2.1.1.tgz">MPSolve
tar file</a> ).&nbsp; For many polynomials, especially ill-conditioned
polynomials of high degree, eigensolve is much faster than MPSolve.&nbsp;&nbsp;
For example, MPSolve takes 2138 seconds on the same example.&nbsp;&nbsp;

of eigensolve, including a comparison with MPSolve, are available.
