<p>The following files give complete timings for eigensolve and mpsolve
on most of the polynomials on the MPSolve web site.&nbsp; In all cases,
both programs computed all roots to at most the relative error specified
by the number of decimal digits.&nbsp; (The command "unisolve -Ga -o<i>n&nbsp;
file</i>" was used for mpsolve and "eigensolve -o<i>n -</i>i200 <i>file</i>"
for eigensolve.)&nbsp; A polynomial may have been&nbsp; skipped because
the running time was too large, or because the format of the file was inappropriate.

</ul>

The results can be summarized as follows.
<ul>
<li>
For dense, ill-conditioned polynomials (Wilkinson, Chebyshev, Laguerre,
Legendre, Sendra etc.), both programs are relatively slow, but eigensolve
is much faster than mpsolve.</li>

<li>
For well-conditioned polynomials (e.g. `easy', 'sparse<i>nnn</i>'), mpsolve
is faster than eigensolve.&nbsp; In some cases, for example polynomials
of degree <i>d </i>several hundred or more,&nbsp; mpsolve reports roots
significantly faster than a single floating-point eigenvalue computation
on a <i>d</i>x<i>d</i> matrix.</li>

<li>
Mpsolve takes advantage of sparsity, and has special hooks for polynomials
that can be evaluated efficiently by straight-line programs.&nbsp; In these
cases mpsolve has an advantage.</li>
</ul>
