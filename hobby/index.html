<h2>Interests</h2>

I am interested in practical algorithms with a geometric flavor, but
my most recent work is on automatic differentiation.
I have also worked on raster graphics, font generation, and more recently
document image analysis.  My work often touches on other fields including
numerical analysis and data compression.
<p>
I have created a graphics language called
<a href="MetaPost.html">MetaPost</a>.  MetaPost is based on
<a href="http://www-cs-faculty.Stanford.EDU/~knuth/">Knuth's</a>
METAFONT, but is intended for figures in technical documents.
<p>
See also <a href="/cm/cs/">historical information</a> about
computing sciences research at bell labs.
