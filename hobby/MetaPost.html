MetaPost is a powerful graphics language based on
<a href="http://www-cs-faculty.Stanford.EDU/~knuth/">Knuth's</a>
METAFONT, but with PostScript output and facilities for including
typeset text.  Details on the language itself are available in
<a href="mppubs.html">various publications</a>.  See also
<a href="http://www.tug.org/metapost.html"> http://www.tug.org/metapost.html</a>
and

The language and its implementation are now in the public domain.

<h2> Sample Output</h2>

MetaPost features <img align="middle" src="fig37.gif" alt="[image]">
curved arrowheads.

<h2> <img src="mplogo.gif" alt="METAPOST or MetaPost?"> </h2>

There is no &quot;official&quot; version of the MetaPost logo.
Both versions are acceptable to me.  I generally use &quot;MetaPost&quot;
in places such as this web page where using TeX's logo10 font would be
awkward.  If you are using LaTeX's
<a href="ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/tex/ctan/macros/latex/contrib/supported/mflogo">
mflogo package</a>, you might as well use <tt>\MP</tt> to get
&quot;<img src="mpsmall.gif" alt="METAPOST">&quot;.

<h2> Driver Support </h2>

MetaPost programs can output standard encapsulated PostScript files,
but these can be difficult to deal with because of the use of TeX fonts
such as <tt>cmr10</tt>.  Such fonts are usually not resident on PostScript
printers, so they have to be downloaded by a dvi-to-PostScript program
that processes TeX output.  Special care is required to ensure that fonts
used by the MetaPost output get downloaded properly.  One dvi-to-PostScript
driver that supports this is Rokicki's
<a href="ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/tex/ctan/dviware/dvips"><tt>dvips</tt></a>.
