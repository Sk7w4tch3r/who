<p>
The MetaPost system implements a language very much like METAFONT except that the
output is expressed with cubic splines and PostScript commands rather than
in METAFONT's raster-oriented Generic Font Format.  It is a powerful language
for expressing figures for documents printed on PostScript printers,
and it can also be used for creating PostScript fonts.
<p>
The data types are mostly the same as in METAFONT, except that pictures
represent a continuous version of what is scan-converted in order to create
METAFONT's pictures.  Some raster-oriented METAFONT primitives are removed
and primitives for expressing PostScript concepts are added.  Facilities
are also included for adding text to pictures.  This should make it convenient
for figures to include labels that match the typography of the rest of the
document.

The MetaPost system implements a picture-drawing language very much like Knuth's
METAFONT except that it outputs PostScript commands instead of run-length-encoded
bitmaps.  MetaPost is a powerful language for producing figures for documents
to be printed on PostScript printers.  It provides easy access to all the
features of PostScript and it includes facilities for integrating text and
graphics.
<p>
This document serves as an introductory user's manual.  It does not require
knowledge of METAFONT or access to <cite>The METAFONTbook</cite>, but both are
beneficial.  An appendix explains the differences between MetaPost and METAFONT.

in a separate report.</em>  See <a href="#gpaper">below</a>

Proceedings of EuroTeX '92, 1992.
<p>
MetaPost is a picture-drawing language very much like METAFONT except with
PostScript output.  The language provides access to all major features
of Level 1 PostScript&#174; and it has facilities for integrating graphics
with typeset text.
<p>
This paper gives a brief overview of the MetaPost language and how it can be
used.  A few of the more interesting features are described in detail.

This paper describes a graph-drawing package that has been implemented
as an extension to the MetaPost graphics language.  MetaPost has
a powerful macro facility for implementing such extensions.  There are
also some new language features that support the graph macros.
Existing features for generating and manipulating pictures
allow the user to do things that would be difficult to achieve
in a stand-alone graph package.
