People can usually stand me only a few years, so that's why I worked in so many places:







<p> 


I did my undergraduate studies in Theoretical Physics at the
<A HREF="http://www1.phys.uu.nl/wwwitf">University of Utrecht</A>.
That was fun. My master thesis was about massless particles with spin>2. 
As far as we know, such particles don't exist. 

Then I started doing my PhD in a different department. 
Not for the last time I worked in a group that was mainly experimental.
At the time the department was called Atomic and Surface Physics, now it's 
<A HREF="http://www1.phys.uu.nl/wwwaf">Atom Optics</A>.

<p>
At some point, though, my supervisor Gerard Nienhuis moved to the
<A HREF="http://molphys.leidenuniv.nl/qo">University of Leiden</A> 
(that's how we Dutch spell Leyden), and so did I. 
Apparently, one can still obtain a 
copy of my Thesis from
<A HREF="http://rulhm1.leidenuniv.nl/qo/pubs/theses.htm">there</A>, with the title "Light as a Thermodynamic Force". It gives a general theory of 
so-called light-induced kinetic effects in gases.
For example, see the paper about the 
<A HREF="http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PRA/v46/i3/p1438_1?qid=75a8c82b7bdd7118&qseq=1&show=10">entropy balance</A> (only if you have a subscription to APS) in 
processes such as laser cooling, where light induces order in matter.

I also started to work on orbital angular momentum of light. One day, I'll have a link to an article about that too.

<p>
Then I moved to Germany, to do a postdoc at the
<A HREF="http://www.mpq.mpg.de">Max-Planck-Institute of Quantum Optics</A> in Garching.
My old group's home page doesn't seem to exist anymore, unfortunately, but we, the Theory Group, had a great time. In fact, I met my wife, Jian Zhang.
Workwise, the emphasis was on calculating the effects of intense laser fields (intensities of roughly 10^8-10^11 W/cm^2 and above) on atoms.




<p>
From Garching it's just a two-hours drive to Innsbruck in Austria. Mind you, if you have a car with a German license plate you are more likely to get a parking ticket. But on the positive side, one can not only ski but do theoretical physics as well. In particular, that's where I started to work on 
<A HREF="http://th-physik.uibk.ac.at/qo">Quantum Information</A>. 
I actually lived in a cabin near a ski lift in <A HREF="http://www.tiscover.at/mutters">Mutters</A>, at some point chosen as the most beautiful village in Tyrol.

<p>The brilliant idea occurred to Jian and me to move to the USA. Now Southern California sounded like a nice place, and indeed, it was. I stayed three years at
<A HREF="http://www.its.caltech.edu/~qoptics">Caltech</A>, enjoying the sun, the nice campus, and the good food in the many Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese, and Thai restaurants.


<p>Now I'm at <a href="http://www.bell-labs.com/">Bell Labs</a>, an amazing place. The weather is not as good as in California, nor is the food.  Well, New York does actually have some good restaurants. I hesitate to mention this, but there is even a Dutch restaurant, called 
<A HREF="http://www.newyorkmetro.com/frame/set.htm?site=http://www.nl-ny.com"> NL</A> (this link seems defunct now).


<p> Worth mentioning is that I was also employed (for one year) at the <A HREF="http://www.iesl.forth.gr"> laser institute</A> in
Heraklion, Crete. I actually only spent a few weeks there but they were awesome weeks (well, most of the time was spent touring Crete). 


<p>To conclude, let me say that from 1996 on I've been working in the field of Quantum Information. 
Since that's still my favorite subject I'll even give a link to my papers on that subject:  
<A HREF="http://xxx.lanl.gov/find/quant-ph/1/au:+Enk_S/0/1/0/all/0/1">
quant-ph</A>, not that anyone is interested.
