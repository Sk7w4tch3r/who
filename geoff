From 1994 through 2001,
I was a Member of Technical Staff at
<a href="http://www.cs.bell-labs.com">Bell Labs</a>
(originally a part of AT&amp;T, now a part of
<a href="http://www.lucent.com">Lucent Technologies</a>)
in Murray Hill, NJ,
where I worked on operating systems and
messaging systems and protocols, among other things.
I rejoined Bell Labs Research on 10 July 2006.

<h2>computing experience</h2>
<ul>

<li>
maintain the original
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/plan9/index.html">Plan 9</a>
<a href="/sys/doc/fs/fs.html">file server kernel</a>
(now upgraded to 64-bit sizes)
and contribute to Plan 9 generally.

<ul>
<li>
merged the big-endian and little-endian MIPS compilers, assemblers and loaders.
<li>
wrote the current (new) Plan 9 <i>tar</i>,
which is cleaner and faster than the old one, and is POSIX-compliant
(i.e., can cope with longer path names).
<li>
modified the
<a href="/sys/doc/fs/fs.html">file server kernel to use 64-bit file sizes</a>,
offsets and block numbers internally,
ported the CPU kernel's IDE code, thus enabling the use of DMA, RWM, etc.,
and ported the CPU kernel's Intel gigabit Ethernet driver.
<li>
added greylisting and other anti-spam measures to
<i>smtpd</i>.
<li>
added multicasting (for IPv6) and shutdown entry points to drivers
for all modern ethernet cards.
updated the connection server to recognise
<tt>icmpv6</tt>.
fixed the kernel to recognise v6 addresses starting with ``20'' as global.
<li>
ported
<i>dbm</i>
and
<i>mdbm</i>
libraries and made them use a consistent byte order on disk,
rendering the databases portable across CPU architectures.
<li>
arranged completely diskless booting of Plan 9 PCs using compact flash cards
<li>
added device mirroring (think RAID 1) to the Plan 9 file server kernel.
Combined with support for IDE disks,
this enables use of inexpensive hardware to form
a large Plan 9 file server.
<li>
set up and ran the largest Plan 9 file server
(with optical disc jukebox)
inside Bell Labs other than the main Plan 9 development file server.
Extended support for jukeboxes with optical disks of varying sizes.
The smaller jukeboxes can now be had second-hand quite cheaply.
</ul>

<li>
on the
<a href="http://www.vitanuova.com/inferno/">inferno</a>
distributed operating system,
built a scalable message store that served a broken-out view of MIME
messages, and designed and implemented <i>rsmtp</i>, an SMTP replacement.
Got Inferno running on Mac OS X.
<li>
configuring IPv6 tunnelling networks
<li>
developed the operating system for the now-defunct AT&amp;T HomeCenter™
set-top box, notably DSP communication, and the C library.
<li>
Unix device drivers
(e.g. for
<!--
<a href="nc.c">radiation cameras</a>,
<a href="tv.c">colour TVs</a>,
-->
<a href="tk.c">Tektronix storage (display) tubes</a> (for V6 Unix),
<a href="sc.c">Nuclear Medicine scintillation counters</a> (for V6 Unix),
terminal multiplexors,
disks),
bootstraps,
and other kernel work
(e.g. putting <kbd>/tmp</kbd> in memory).
<li>
reverse-engineering (``decompiling'') manual pages from
<i>nroff</i> output to <i>troff -man</i> input:
 <a href="nam.dist.tar">nam</a>
<li>
Unix system programming and running Unix systems
(including 8th and 9th edition)
for almost a decade at
<a href="http://www.toronto.edu/">the University of Toronto</a>,
notably for
<a href="http://www.toronto.edu/utcc/">the computing center</a>,
<a href="http://www.cdf.toronto.edu/">undergraduate computer science instruction</a>,
and
<a href="http://www.utstat.toronto.edu/">the statistics department</a>.
<li>
set up the original <kbd>bell-labs.com</kbd> servers
during the ATT/Lucent split,
notably DNS and mail servers on Plan 9 and internal and
<a href="http://www-out.bell-labs.com">external</a>
web servers.
</ul>

<h2>publications</h2>
<ul>
<li>
assigning interrupt priorities in software
via interrupt queueing, in Computing Systems, Spring 1996
<li>
evolution of operating systems:
Research Unix in
 <a href="history.html">html</a> and
 <a href="history.ps">postscript</a>
(updated 23 Dec 1998 to more closely match the printed article
in Microsystems in 1984).
Also, a new, improved draft that fixes a number of errors we missed the
first time around and adds real references, in
 <a href="hist.daenews.html">html</a> and
 <a href="hist.daenews.ps">postscript</a>.
<li>
software reimplementation:
 <a href="sh.tour.ps">the shell</a>,
including
 <a href="stak.c"><tt>stak.c</tt></a> from the appendix,
and a newer, tidier
 <a href="stak.port.c"><tt>stak.c</tt></a>
that eliminates
<tt>struct</tt>
alignment problems that showed up on the Alpha.
I've retrofitted the above memory-management, directory-reading
and a few other changes into a <a href="v7sh.tar">V7 sh</a>
that should run on POSIXy systems.
It's been run on the BSDs and Linux on x86 PCs without trouble.
Among its other features,
it lacks the GNU
<i>readline</i>
library, so what you type is what you get.
<i>Update!</i>
<tt>Mon Mar 7 04:03:13 PST 2005</tt>:
To get it running on 64-bit Suns, I had to change two declarations;
<tt>v7sh.tar</tt> and the newer <tt>stak.c</tt> have been updated.
<li>
performance tuning and more software reimplementation:
 <a href="newspaper.ps">C news netnews software</a>
<li>
programming style:
 <a href="ifdefs.ps">no ifdefs</a>,
 <a href="cant.html">can't happen</a>
 <a href="cant.ps">(postscript)</a>
<li>

 <a href="referee.ps">othello</a>
</ul>

<h2>computing interests</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://plan9.bell-labs.com/plan9/index.html">Plan 9</a>,
the successor to Unix;
a distributed system
drawing on over 20 years of experience with Unix
<ul>
<li>
my own
<a href="9/">contributions</a>
of Plan 9 software
<li>
an early outline of a proposed-but-rejected book about
<a href="9book.html">why Plan 9 matters</a>.
Pardon the formatting; it was converted to HTML mechanically.
</ul>
<li>
the
<a href="http://www.vitanuova.com/inferno/">inferno</a>
distributed system,
derived from Plan 9,
and the
<a href="http://www.vitanuova.com/inferno/papers/descent.html">limbo</a>
language, which features particularly helpful support
for processes sharing address space.
If POSIX <i>pthreads</i> give you the willies,
<i>limbo</i> might be for you.
<i>inferno</i> runs on bare 386 or Sparc hardware
and as a `guest OS' on the usual (l)Unixes and MS Windows.
<li>
archiving and optical media, notably CD-R.
Plan 9 has a convenient backup system using optical disks,
discussed in its
 <a href="/sys/doc/9.html">overview</a>,
 <a href="/sys/doc/fs/fs.html">file server</a>
and
 <a href="/sys/doc/port.html">port</a>
papers.
The
<a href="http://www.cs.bell-labs.com/who/seanq/pub.html#venti"><i>venti</i></a>
block store looks promising and I'm running a
<i>venti</i>
store for general experimentation.
<i>Fossil</i>,
the file server built on top of
<i>venti</i>,
shows promise too, but is less mature and needs to be shaken down severely.
<li>
indexing.
<a href="nov.dist.tar.gz">This</a>
is the distribution of my
<i>nov</i>
news overview database code.
<i>Nov</i>
is now incorporated into essentially all serious newsreaders.
<li>
software reimplementation:
 <a href="ftp://ftp.cs.york.ac.uk/papers/taste.ps.Z">More Taste, Less Greed</a>
<li>
strong cryptography as an aid to privacy and civil rights
<li>
Mac OS X's Safari is a pretty good web browser.
If you buy a used Mac, I have
<a href="mac/used.mac.notes.html">my notes</a> from buying an upgraded Mac and
<a href="mac/">others' documentation</a>,
including dealing with OpenFirmware.
My trials with adding PCI Ethernet cards are
<a href="mac/pci.ether.html">here</a>.
These days, I'd recommend buying a new Mac if you can afford it,
or one with built-in USB, so you can run Panther, if not.

<h2>undocumented things you may need to know</h2>

<h3>how to configure Vonage's Motorola VT1005V VOIP phone adapter</h3>
The thing won't talk to anybody initially.
It's initially configured to be <tt>192.168.102.1</tt>
and listen for web connections; that's documented.
What doesn't appear to be documented is that the machine running
the web browser needs to have,
possibly as one of several,
the IP address <tt>192.168.102.99</tt>.
I found this in a discussion forum on <tt>broadbandreports.com</tt>
and it works.
<p>
Also, the RJ-45 Ethernet port labelled `PC' is expecting a cross-over
Ethernet cable if you plug it into a switch rather than directly into a
computer.
If you do plug it into a switch, it's a wise precaution to unplug the WAN
port first to avoid the possibility of looping packets.
<p>
It's arguably a bug that the box won't respond to pings from anybody else
(nor will <tt>vonage.com</tt> nor <tt>www.vonage.com</tt>).
<p>
The ``diagnostics'' available when something goes wrong
consists of a single blinking light, the meanings of which
are documented.
What's apparently not documented is that the light lies.
From personal experience,
some operations seem to just time-out and the box moves onto the next step.
It's entirely possible to get the box into its `light on solid' state,
which is supposed to mean that it's ready to go, without it having
made contact with Vonage's servers.
<p>
Adding a serial port, through which one could configure the box and
receive error messages, would be a big step forward.
<p>
The box is a little too eager to be your router and NAT translator
and serve DHCP.
