<TITLE>Large Deviations for Performance Analysis</TITLE>
<H4>Synopsis</H4>

This book consists of two synergistic parts.<P>

The first half is the theory of large deviations developed from the beginning (i.i.d. random variables) through recent results on the theory for processes with boundaries, keeping to a very narrow path: continuous-time, discrete-state processes. By developing only what we need for the applications we present, we to keep the theory to a manageable level, both in terms of length and in terms
of difficulty. Since our scope is limited to a class of relatively simple processes, the theory is accessible, and less demanding mathematically, than more general treatments. Within our scope, our treatment is detailed, comprehensive and self-contained. As the book shows, there are sufficienty many interesting applications of jump Markov processes to warrant a special treatment.  After all, we live in continuous time, and the events that occur in digital equipment are discrete.<P>

We firmly believe that the large deviations of processes should be taught first for jump Markov processes: more difficult processes can be studied once the foundations and the intuition are established.  Diffusions are complicated objects, and the student does not need the extra burden of a subtle process to hinder the understanding of large deviations. Discrete time presents another unnecessarily difficult process, because the jumps are usually more general than those of the processes we consider.<P>

The second half of the book is a collection of applications developed at AT&T Bell Laboratories. Our applications cover large areas of the theory of communication networks: circuit-switched transmission (Chapter 12), packet transmission (Chapter 13), multiple access channels (Chapter 14), and the M/M/1 queue (Chapter 11). We cover aspects of parallel computation in a much more spotty fashion: basics of job allocation (Chapter 9), rollback-based parallel simulation (Chapter 10), assorted priority queuing models (Chapter 15) that may be used in performance models of various computer architectures, and asymptotic
coupling of processors (Chapter 16).<P>
