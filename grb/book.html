<h1><cite>Distributed Systems Analysis with CCS</cite></h1></center>

<hr>
<p>
This book was published in 1997 by
Prentice Hall in the Tony Hoare (orange and white) series.
The book describes how process algebra, temporal logic, and
automated tools can be used in the modelling and analysis of
distributed systems.  The first part of the book is a
tutorial introduction to CCS and temporal logic.  The rest
of the book describes how industrial systems have been
treated with this approach.  If you have the book you might
want to see a list of minor <A HREF="errata.html">errors</A>
that have been found in it.
