<h1>vp - A Value-Passing Translator for CCS</h1>

<hr>
<p> Process algebras are designed to capture the essense of
distributed computing in a minimal fashion, so it's not
surprising that they are bad for describing complex
distributed systems.  While at the University of Edinburgh I
spent some time using CCS and temporal logic to analyze
safety-critical systems, and quickly learned how painful it
is to describe systems with basic CCS.  One really needs the
suport for data found in an extended process algebra like
value-passing form of CCS.  Unfortunately, many tools for
process algebras, like the Edinburgh Concurrency Workbench,
do not support value-passing processes.  I therefore
developed (with the help of Stuart Anderson) a value-passing
CCS notation and a compiler to translate value-passing CCS
to basic CCS.  This tool is called <em>vp</em>.

p>
The value-passing language supported by vp includes the
constructs defined by Robin Milner in Communication and
Concurrency, plus some other features, notably indexed
actions and extensions for timed CCS.  For data the language
supports sets, tuples, and lists, all of which are built up
out of boolean, integer, and string constants.  The
translator can produce basic CCS in two formats: one for the
Edinburgh Concurrency Workbench and the other for the
Concurrency Workbench of New Jersey.

<p>
The value-passing translator is written in Standard ML of
New Jersey.  Binaries for Sun workstations are freely
available.  If you are interested in building the compiler
for us on other machines, or are interested in extending the
compiler, please contact me.

<p>
There is now also a Java-based version of the value-passing
translator, named "jvp".  A beta version of it is available
for download (see below).  This version is faster than the
the ML version, requires no installation, and supports
timed CCS.  However, it currently produces output only for the 
Edinburgh Concurrency Workbench.

<p>
Notice: this software (both the ML and Java versions) is for 
educational and research purposes only.  It is not to be used 
as the basis for commercial products.
