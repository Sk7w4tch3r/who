* Failure properties of Slowscan model
*

* no deadlock 
prop DeadlockFree = max(X.<<-eps>>T & [[-]]X);

* only failures are reported
prop NoFalseFail = max(X.[[det]]F & [[-fail]]X);

* a failure will always be reported
prop DetectsFail = max(X.[[fail]]min(Y.[[-det,eps]]Y) & [[-fail]]X);

* a fail will always be reported (equivalent version)
prop DetectsFail1 = max(X.[fail]min(Y.max(Z.[fail,io]Y & [tau]Z)) & [-fail]X);
