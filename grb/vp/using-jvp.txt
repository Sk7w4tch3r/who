1. Usage

The translator can be invoked at the command line as follows:

    java -jar jvp.jar sched.vp

where in this case the input file is "sched.vp".  The output
is written to "sched.ccs".  (Note that some ancient versions of 
Java do not support the "-jar" option.)

Of course, jvp.jar can instead be put in the java CLASSPATH.
See Sun's Java documentation if you don't know what this means.

2. Restrictions and notes

The translator supports timed CCS features as described in
a separate note.

Output is in Edinburgh CWB format only.

I believe all of the value operators described in the vp-ccs
language definition are now supported.

Note that the "div" operator returns the ceiling of a/b.
For example, 2 div 3 = 2.  This is different than you'd
get from integer division in Java and many other languages.

3. Bugs, features

Please email grb@alcatel-lucent.com with requests for
bug fixes or new features.
