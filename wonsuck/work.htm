          <p><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="2">Multiphase flow occurs in many
          natural and engineering settings and daily life. Kinematics and
          dynamics of&nbsp; the fluids flow are much difficult to study compare
          to the ones of single phase case. Simulation in general multiphase
          flow setting requires independent solution of each phase as well as
          simultaneous consideration of interfacial solution. Furthermore phase
          transition makes picture even complicated.&nbsp;</font></p>
          <p><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="2">My research concerns theoretical and
          its computational validation for fluids mixing and interfacial instabilities.&nbsp;
          There are</font> <font face="MS Sans Serif" size="2">there are 3
          widely studied subjects in fluid instabilities: 1) shock wave driven
          Richtmeyer-Meshkov instability, 2) constant force driven&nbsp;
          Rayleigh-Taylor Instability 3) temperature gradient driven Kelvin-Helmholz
          instability.&nbsp; All the topics have show its face in many real
          world application, for instances, fusion, supernova, nuclear reaction,
          global atmosphere movement etc. My research can find its applications
          in Richtmeyer-Meshkov instability or more favorably in Rayleigh-Taylor
          instability.&nbsp;</font></p>
          <p><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="2">I investigated two-phase flow
          setting from a 
          <font color="#33CCFF">Theory of Averaged Equations</font> 
          point of view but not from micro scale continuum fluid mechanics 
          point of view. In other words,
          rather than point-wise solution of fluid dynamics, I researched
          macroscopic behavior of two-phase fluids motion, like, mixing length
          growth rate, center of mixing region dynamics etc.</font></p>

        <blockquote>
          <p><font size="2" face="MS Sans Serif">I am interested in modeling of
          physical process in random field (RF) setting. Namely <font color="#33CCFF">Modeling
          of Randomness in Continuum Mechanics</font>. Here I need to clarify a
          few things before I proceed. The principle of Quantum Physics, <font color="#33CCFF">Natural
          process is inherently random</font>, does not contain set of my
          research topics. My research is standing on the ground of continuum
          fluid mechanics which assume to have pretty regular solution. My
          basics assumption for modeling of randomness is lack of knowledge or
          uncertainty from lack of information. In other words I effort&nbsp; to
          obtain, so to say, macro-macro solution in probabilistic sense. Hence
          my solution stands on top of statistical aggregates. There are many
          application that we cannot predict its solution in deterministic
          fashion, porous media flow is one of the famous engineering problems
          in this category. Fluid through porous formation
          has applications in groundwater hydrology, environmental remediation, and problems of petroleum engineering
          and many other areas. I analyzed tracer flow, miscible identical
          two-phase flow,&nbsp; through random porous media using stochastic
          method&nbsp; for curved geometries as well as a planar case.&nbsp;</font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="MS Sans Serif">I also worked on
          groundwater simulator. It is a full two-phase, water as a wetting
          phase and air as a non-wetting phase, simulation with capillary effect
          considered. A fully coupled air and water underground flow model was
          developed under IPARS
          framework. IPARS (Integrared Accurate Parallel Reservoir Simulator) is
          a underground flow simulation framework developed by researchers at
          TICAM (Texas Institute of Computational and Applied Mathematics),
          University of Texas at Austin.&nbsp;</font></p>

              Partial Differential Equation</font></b>
              <p><font size="2" face="MS Sans Serif">As is mentioned in previous
              paragraph, many physical systems require mathematical description&nbsp; of partial
              differential equation (PDE)&nbsp; with coefficients or terms of
              random field. Scientists often call it stochastic differential
              equations. If only one term or coefficient in PDE is random , the
              solution of the system must be random. Therefore the mathematical
              system doesn't give us any deterministic answer to our question.
              However we can deduce probable solution under probability law with
              given statistics of random fields. Through modeling we could
              obtain answer meaningful only in statistical sense but essential
              information for a specific case of the problems.</font></p>

              <p><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="2">My primary work in this
              area was applying the Interior-Point method to flash&nbsp; calculation of reservoir simulation.
              By flash calculation, one wants to find phase equilibrium in
              multiphase fluids setting. Multiphase flow and phase change can
              make Newtonian iteration to this nonlinear algebraic system hard
              to solve and often fail due to bad initial guess and unknown
              number of phases at certain flow simulation stage.&nbsp;</font></p>
    <p><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="2">For inequality constraint
    optimization problems, there are two widely adapted methods: (1) SQP, (2)
    Interior-Point. Because of&nbsp; the unpredictable nonlinearity of the
    equality and inequality constraints, nonlinear interior-point methods are
    more suitable than SQP algorithm. I applied Newton-Damped Nonlinear
    Interior-Point algorithm for Gas-Oil-Water three phase flow system.</font></p>

              <p><font size="2" face="MS Sans Serif">One of the unique
              characteristics of flow through porous media is the scale- effect:
              fluid transport and mixing depends on the history
              of fluid flow.&nbsp; Non-local dispersion is the key factor which describe this
              phenomenon.&nbsp; I designed a numerical scheme, mixed finite
              elements method in the lowest order Raviar-Thoma spave, that is,
              finite volume methods for an parabolic type integro-differential equation&nbsp;
              in one dimesional case. I have done convergence study in the
              context of Lax-Richtnyer Theory. I showed that the scheme is
              stable, the integro-differential equation has parabolic and
              hyperbolic nature depends on the kernel operator. &nbsp;</font></p>

    are many engineering applications can be aided by computer simulation. Often
    it is very beneficiary if engineers can track and steer simulation while it
    is still running. Scientists' and engineers' insight and prediction can be
    tested and immerged while simulation running without many test runs wait
    until final output produced. Furthermore if the tracking and steering is
    supported by real time visualization and allows collaboration between
    participating scientists, it will be virtual conference room in cyber space.
    DISCOVER , developed at CAIP at Rutgers University, provide this virtual
    environment for tracking/steering simulation. </font></li>
